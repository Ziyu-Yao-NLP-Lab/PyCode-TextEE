Event Schema:
Event Name and its parent class

```

### Instructions ###
1. Identify and List All Unique Arguments: 
   - Carefully review the schema to identify all arguments relevant to the event type.
   - Please remember that the examples may not cover all the arguments in the list. In some cases, you may not have arguments at all, in such cases, you can have an empty list for arguments. 
2. Define the Event Type: Write 5 clear and specific definitions, starting with "The event is triggered by ...":
   - Include example triggers.
   - Highlight key characteristics and scope of the event.
   - Compare and contrast with closely related events using provided negative examples.
   - Explain how triggers and outcomes differ for similar event types.
3. Define Each Argument:** For each argument, provide 5 definitions with detailed examples, starting with "Examples are ...":
   - Explain the role and importance of each argument.
   - Include domain knowledge and address edge cases to clarify ambiguities.
4. Focus on Distinctions: Use positive examples to describe the event, and negative examples to clarify what the event is not. Explicitly state differences using phrases like:
   - "Unlike [Related Event Type], this event does not ..."
   - "Triggers such as [Trigger] are indicative of [Related Event Type], not this event type."
5. Structured Output: Present the output in the following JSON format:

         "Definition 5"
       ],
       "Argument2": [
         "Definition 1",
         "Definition 2",
         "Definition 3",
         "Definition 4",
         "Definition 5"
       ]
       // Add more arguments if applicable
     }
   }
   ```

### Output Requirements ###
