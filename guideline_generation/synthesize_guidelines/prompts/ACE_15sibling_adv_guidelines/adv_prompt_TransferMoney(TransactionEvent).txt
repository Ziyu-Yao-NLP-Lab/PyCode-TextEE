You are an expert in summarizing NLP event extraction guidelines. Your goal is to consolidate multiple detailed descriptions into a single concise, comprehensive "Advanced" guideline.

### Input Format ###
Event Type: Event Type Name
```json
{
  "Event Definition": [
    "Definition 1",
    "Definition 2",
    "Definition 3",
    "Definition 4",
    "Definition 5"
  ],
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    "Argument1": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    // Add additional arguments as necessary
  }
}
```

### Task ###
1. Consolidate the 5 definitions under "Event Definition" into a single definition:
   - Highlight all critical points and examples from the five definitions.
   - Ensure the description is concise, comprehensive, and clear, using formal language that non-experts can understand.

2. Do the same for each argument under "Arguments Definitions," producing a single advanced definition for each. 

### Output Format ###
```json
{
  "Event Definition": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the event type.",
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the mention argument.",
    "Argument1": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument1.",
    "Argument2": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument2."
    // Add additional arguments as applicable
  }
}
```

### Guidelines to Summarize ###
Event Type: prompt_TransferMoney(TransactionEvent)
```json
{
    "TransferMoney(TransactionEvent)": {
        "description": [
            "The event is triggered by actions involving the transfer of money from one entity to another. Example triggers include 'pay', 'give', 'settle', 'funded', and 'cost'.",
            "The event is characterized by the movement of monetary value, typically involving a giver and a recipient. It is distinct from other transaction events that may involve the transfer of goods or services.",
            "Unlike TransferOwnership, this event does not involve the transfer of physical or intellectual property. Triggers such as 'providing' and 'selling' are indicative of TransferOwnership, not TransferMoney.",
            "The event often involves financial transactions, settlements, fines, or payments, and can occur in various contexts such as legal settlements, donations, or commercial transactions.",
            "The outcome of the event is the successful transfer of money, which can be identified by the presence of monetary amounts and the entities involved in the transaction."
        ]
    },
    "attributes": {
        "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
        "beneficiary": [
            "The beneficiary is the entity that ultimately benefits from the transfer of money. Examples are 'Democrats' in the context of donations or 'neighbor' in the context of compensation.",
            "The beneficiary is often the recipient of the financial gain, but not necessarily the direct recipient of the money. For instance, in a donation, the beneficiary could be the organization that benefits from the funds.",
            "In legal contexts, the beneficiary might be the party awarded damages or compensation. For example, 'clients' in a settlement case.",
            "The beneficiary can be an individual, organization, or group. Examples include 'research center' funded by a donation or 'neighbor' compensated for distress.",
            "Unlike the recipient, the beneficiary is the one who gains from the transaction, which may not always be the direct receiver of the funds."
        ],
        "giver": [
            "The giver is the entity that provides the money in the transaction. Examples are 'Planned Parenthood' in a donation or 'girls' in a compensation case.",
            "The giver is responsible for initiating the transfer of money, whether voluntarily or as a result of a legal obligation. For instance, 'Sotheby's' in a settlement agreement.",
            "In commercial contexts, the giver could be a business or individual making a payment. Examples include 'houses' in an auction settlement or 'Mikhail Gorbachev' funding a research center.",
            "The giver can be an individual, organization, or group. Examples include 'Christie's' in a settlement or 'clients' paying a fine.",
            "Unlike the beneficiary, the giver is the source of the funds being transferred, regardless of the reason for the transfer."
        ],
        "place": [
            "The place is the location where the transaction occurs or is relevant. Examples are 'Colorado' in a legal ruling or 'United States' in an auction settlement.",
            "The place can refer to the jurisdiction or geographical area associated with the transaction. For instance, 'Belgrade' in a property transfer case.",
            "In some cases, the place may be implied by the context of the transaction, such as 'outside the United States' in an international settlement.",
            "The place is important for understanding the legal and contextual background of the transaction. Examples include 'Colorado' in a court ruling or '34 countries' where a company operates.",
            "Unlike the giver or recipient, the place is a geographical reference that provides context to the transaction but does not directly participate in the transfer."
        ],
        "recipient": [
            "The recipient is the entity that directly receives the money in the transaction. Examples are 'Democrats' in a donation or 'neighbor' in a compensation case.",
            "The recipient is the immediate receiver of the funds, which may or may not be the ultimate beneficiary. For instance, 'center' funded by a donation from 'Mikhail Gorbachev'.",
            "In legal contexts, the recipient might be the party receiving the payment as part of a settlement. Examples include 'firms' receiving a fine payment.",
            "The recipient can be an individual, organization, or group. Examples include 'neighbor' in a compensation case or 'center' funded by a donation.",
            "Unlike the beneficiary, the recipient is the direct receiver of the funds, which may be passed on to the ultimate beneficiary."
