You are an expert in summarizing NLP event extraction guidelines. Your goal is to consolidate multiple detailed descriptions into a single concise, comprehensive "Advanced" guideline.

### Input Format ###
Event Type: Event Type Name
```json
{
  "Event Definition": [
    "Definition 1",
    "Definition 2",
    "Definition 3",
    "Definition 4",
    "Definition 5"
  ],
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    "Argument1": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    // Add additional arguments as necessary
  }
}
```

### Task ###
1. Consolidate the 5 definitions under "Event Definition" into a single definition:
   - Highlight all critical points and examples from the five definitions.
   - Ensure the description is concise, comprehensive, and clear, using formal language that non-experts can understand.

2. Do the same for each argument under "Arguments Definitions," producing a single advanced definition for each. 

### Output Format ###
```json
{
  "Event Definition": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the event type.",
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the mention argument.",
    "Argument1": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument1.",
    "Argument2": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument2."
    // Add additional arguments as applicable
  }
}
```

### Guidelines to Summarize ###
Event Type: prompt_Attack(ConflictEvent)
```json
{
    "Attack(ConflictEvent)": {
        "description": [
            "The event is triggered by actions that involve physical or violent confrontation, such as 'killed', 'raping and drugging', 'blast', 'tore', 'explosion', 'clashed', 'clashes', and 'war'.",
            "The event is characterized by an aggressive act where one party (attacker) inflicts harm or damage on another party (victim or target) using various means (instruments) at a specific location (place).",
            "Unlike Demonstrate events, which involve peaceful or organized protests, Attack events involve direct physical harm or violence. For example, 'clashed' in the context of a violent confrontation is an Attack event, whereas 'rally' in the context of a peaceful protest is a Demonstrate event.",
            "Triggers such as 'blast' and 'explosion' indicate an Attack event, as they involve sudden and violent destruction, unlike 'rally', which indicates a peaceful gathering.",
            "The outcomes of Attack events typically include injury, death, or destruction, distinguishing them from other ConflictEvent types that may not result in physical harm, such as Demonstrate events."
        ]
    },
    "attributes": {
        "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
        "agent": [
            "Examples are individuals or groups initiating the attack, such as 'luster' in the context of 'raping and drugging'.",
            "The agent is the entity responsible for carrying out the attack, often synonymous with the attacker.",
            "In some cases, the agent may be a broader entity or organization behind the attack, not directly involved in the physical act.",
            "The agent is crucial for understanding the source of the attack and can include individuals, groups, or organizations.",
            "Edge cases include situations where the agent is not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from context, such as 'police' in a clash scenario."
        ],
        "attacker": [
            "Examples are entities directly involved in the attack, such as 'mob' in the context of 'killed'.",
            "The attacker is the party that physically executes the attack, often causing harm or damage.",
            "In some cases, multiple attackers may be involved, as seen with 'demonstrators' and 'police' in a clash.",
            "The attacker is distinct from the agent in that the attacker is directly involved in the physical act, while the agent may be the broader entity behind it.",
            "Edge cases include situations where the attacker is not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from context, such as 'demonstrators' in a clash scenario."
        ],
        "instrument": [
            "Examples are tools or weapons used in the attack, such as 'machetes' and 'spears' in the context of 'killed'.",
            "The instrument is the means by which the attack is carried out, often causing physical harm or damage.",
            "In some cases, the instrument may be a non-physical means, such as 'devices' used in clashes.",
            "The instrument is crucial for understanding the method of the attack and can include weapons, tools, or other means.",
            "Edge cases include situations where the instrument is not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from context, such as 'bomb' in an explosion scenario."
        ],
        "place": [
            "Examples are locations where the attack occurs, such as 'area' in the context of 'killed' and 'airport' in the context of 'blast'.",
            "The place is the physical location where the attack takes place, providing context for the event.",
            "In some cases, the place may be a broader region or country, such as 'Iraq' in the context of 'war'.",
            "The place is crucial for understanding the geographical context of the attack and can include specific locations, cities, or countries.",
            "Edge cases include situations where the place is not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from context, such as 'shed' in an explosion scenario."
        ],
        "target": [
            "Examples are entities or objects that are the focus of the attack, such as 'them' in the context of 'killed' and 'terminal' in the context of 'explosion'.",
            "The target is the entity or object that the attack is directed towards, often suffering harm or damage.",
            "In some cases, the target may be a broader group or entity, such as 'officers' in a clash scenario.",
            "The target is crucial for understanding the focus of the attack and can include individuals, groups, or objects.",
            "Edge cases include situations where the target is not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from context, such as 'shed' in an explosion scenario."
        ],
        "victim": [
            "Examples are individuals or groups harmed by the attack, such as 'women' in the context of 'raping and drugging'.",
            "The victim is the party that suffers harm or damage as a result of the attack.",
            "In some cases, the victim may be a broader group or entity, such as 'people' in a blast scenario.",
            "The victim is crucial for understanding the impact of the attack and can include individuals, groups, or organizations.",
            "Edge cases include situations where the victim is not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from context, such as 'officers' in a clash scenario."
        ]
