You are an expert in summarizing NLP event extraction guidelines. Your goal is to consolidate multiple detailed descriptions into a single concise, comprehensive "Advanced" guideline.

### Input Format ###
Event Type: Event Type Name
```json
{
  "Event Definition": [
    "Definition 1",
    "Definition 2",
    "Definition 3",
    "Definition 4",
    "Definition 5"
  ],
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    "Argument1": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    // Add additional arguments as necessary
  }
}
```

### Task ###
1. Consolidate the 5 definitions under "Event Definition" into a single definition:
   - Highlight all critical points and examples from the five definitions.
   - Ensure the description is concise, comprehensive, and clear, using formal language that non-experts can understand.

2. Do the same for each argument under "Arguments Definitions," producing a single advanced definition for each. 

### Output Format ###
```json
{
  "Event Definition": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the event type.",
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the mention argument.",
    "Argument1": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument1.",
    "Argument2": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument2."
    // Add additional arguments as applicable
  }
}
```

### Guidelines to Summarize ###
Event Type: prompt_Sue(JusticeEvent)
```json
{
    "Sue(JusticeEvent)": {
        "description": [
            "The event is triggered by legal actions where one party (plaintiff) initiates a lawsuit against another party (defendant). Example triggers include 'lawsuit', 'sued', 'litigation', 'action', and 'claims'.",
            "The event is characterized by the formal process of bringing a legal case to court, typically involving a plaintiff and a defendant. It often involves seeking a legal remedy or compensation.",
            "Unlike other JusticeEvent types such as 'Appeal' or 'Sentence', the 'Sue' event specifically involves the initiation of legal proceedings by a plaintiff against a defendant, rather than the review or outcome of a case.",
            "Triggers such as 'appealed' or 'sentenced' are indicative of 'Appeal' or 'Sentence' events, not the 'Sue' event type. The 'Sue' event focuses on the commencement of legal action.",
            "The outcome of a 'Sue' event is the initiation of a legal case, which may lead to further legal processes such as trials, settlements, or judgments. It does not encompass the final judgment or sentencing."
        ]
    },
    "attributes": {
        "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
        "adjudicator": [
            "Examples are 'courts', 'judge', 'jury'. The adjudicator is the entity responsible for overseeing and making decisions in the legal case.",
            "The adjudicator plays a crucial role in ensuring the legal process is followed and in delivering a verdict or judgment.",
            "In some cases, the adjudicator may be a specific court or judge, while in others, it may refer to a broader judicial body.",
            "Unlike the plaintiff or defendant, the adjudicator is neutral and does not have a vested interest in the outcome of the case.",
            "Edge cases may include situations where the adjudicator is not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the context, such as 'the court' or 'the judge'."
        ],
        "defendant": [
            "Examples are 'Iraq', 'Crichton', 'bankers'. The defendant is the party against whom the lawsuit is filed.",
            "The defendant is typically accused of some wrongdoing or liability and is required to respond to the plaintiff's claims.",
            "In some cases, the defendant may be an individual, while in others, it may be an organization or government entity.",
            "Unlike the plaintiff, the defendant is the party that must defend against the legal action and may face penalties or obligations if found liable.",
            "Edge cases may include situations where the defendant is not explicitly named but can be inferred from the context, such as 'the accused' or 'the respondent'."
        ],
        "place": [
            "Examples are 'Washington', 'United States', 'court'. The place refers to the location where the legal action is filed or takes place.",
            "The place is important as it determines the jurisdiction and legal framework under which the case is adjudicated.",
            "In some cases, the place may be a specific court or city, while in others, it may refer to a broader region or country.",
            "Unlike the adjudicator or parties involved, the place is a geographical reference that provides context for the legal proceedings.",
            "Edge cases may include situations where the place is not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the context, such as 'the local court' or 'the federal court'."
        ],
        "plaintiff": [
            "Examples are 'relatives', 'survivors', 'Enron Corp'. The plaintiff is the party that initiates the lawsuit and seeks legal remedy or compensation.",
            "The plaintiff is typically the party that claims to have been wronged or harmed and seeks redress through the legal system.",
            "In some cases, the plaintiff may be an individual, while in others, it may be a group of people or an organization.",
            "Unlike the defendant, the plaintiff is the party that brings the legal action and must provide evidence to support their claims.",
            "Edge cases may include situations where the plaintiff is not explicitly named but can be inferred from the context, such as 'the complainant' or 'the claimant'."
        ]
    }
}
