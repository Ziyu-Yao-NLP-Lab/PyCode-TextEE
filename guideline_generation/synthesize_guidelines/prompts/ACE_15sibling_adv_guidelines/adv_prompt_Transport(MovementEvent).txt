You are an expert in summarizing NLP event extraction guidelines. Your goal is to consolidate multiple detailed descriptions into a single concise, comprehensive "Advanced" guideline.

### Input Format ###
Event Type: Event Type Name
```json
{
  "Event Definition": [
    "Definition 1",
    "Definition 2",
    "Definition 3",
    "Definition 4",
    "Definition 5"
  ],
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    "Argument1": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    // Add additional arguments as necessary
  }
}
```

### Task ###
1. Consolidate the 5 definitions under "Event Definition" into a single definition:
   - Highlight all critical points and examples from the five definitions.
   - Ensure the description is concise, comprehensive, and clear, using formal language that non-experts can understand.

2. Do the same for each argument under "Arguments Definitions," producing a single advanced definition for each. 

### Output Format ###
```json
{
  "Event Definition": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the event type.",
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the mention argument.",
    "Argument1": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument1.",
    "Argument2": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument2."
    // Add additional arguments as applicable
  }
}
```

### Guidelines to Summarize ###
Event Type: prompt_Transport(MovementEvent)
```json
{
    "Transport(MovementEvent)": {
        "description": [
            "The event is triggered by verbs or phrases indicating the movement of entities from one place to another, such as 'transport', 'drive', 'fly', 'bring', 'head', 'parachute', and 'cart'.",
            "The event is characterized by the involvement of an agent or vehicle facilitating the movement, and an artifact or victim being moved. The movement typically involves a clear origin and destination.",
            "Unlike other MovementEvent types, the Transport event specifically involves the conveyance of entities, often with a focus on the means or method of transportation.",
            "Triggers such as 'walk', 'run', or 'swim' are indicative of other MovementEvent types like 'Travel' or 'Journey', not the Transport event type.",
            "The outcome of a Transport event is the successful relocation of the artifact or victim to a new place, often facilitated by an agent or vehicle."
        ]
    },
    "attributes": {
        "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
        "agent": [
            "Examples are 'forces', 'medical teams', 'parents'. The agent is the entity responsible for facilitating the transport.",
            "The agent plays a crucial role in initiating and managing the transport process.",
            "In some cases, the agent may be an organization or group, such as 'US forces' or 'police'.",
            "The agent is distinct from the artifact or victim being transported.",
            "Edge cases include scenarios where the agent is implied but not explicitly mentioned, such as 'troops headed for Iraq'."
        ],
        "artifact": [
            "Examples are 'women', 'children', 'victims', 'protesters', 'Liana Owen'. The artifact is the entity being transported.",
            "The artifact is the primary focus of the transport event, as it is the entity being moved from one location to another.",
            "Artifacts can be individuals, groups of people, or objects.",
            "Unlike the agent, the artifact does not facilitate the transport but is the subject of the movement.",
            "Edge cases include scenarios where the artifact is a collective group, such as 'troops' or 'protesters'."
        ],
        "destination": [
            "Examples are 'Sudan', 'Iraq', 'Manhattan', 'home', 'airfield'. The destination is the endpoint of the transport.",
            "The destination is crucial for defining the scope and goal of the transport event.",
            "It is the location where the artifact or victim is intended to arrive.",
            "Unlike the origin, the destination is the final point in the transport process.",
            "Edge cases include scenarios where the destination is implied but not explicitly mentioned, such as 'headed for Iraq'."
        ],
        "origin": [
            "Examples are 'Sudan', 'Pennsylvania', 'Fort Hood'. The origin is the starting point of the transport.",
            "The origin provides context for where the transport begins.",
            "It is the location from which the artifact or victim is moved.",
            "Unlike the destination, the origin is the initial point in the transport process.",
            "Edge cases include scenarios where the origin is implied but not explicitly mentioned, such as 'flying out of Fort Hood'."
        ],
        "place": [
            "Examples are 'Iraq'. The place is a general location associated with the transport event.",
            "The place provides additional context for the transport event, often indicating a broader area involved.",
            "It is not as specific as the origin or destination but helps situate the event geographically.",
            "Unlike the origin or destination, the place may not indicate a specific start or end point.",
            "Edge cases include scenarios where the place is a large region or country, such as 'across the United States and Canada'."
        ],
        "vehicle": [
            "Examples are 'trains'. The vehicle is the means of transportation used in the event.",
            "The vehicle is crucial for understanding how the transport is facilitated.",
            "It can be any mode of transport, such as cars, planes, trains, or ships.",
            "Unlike the agent, the vehicle is the tool or method used for the transport, not the entity facilitating it.",
            "Edge cases include scenarios where the vehicle is implied but not explicitly mentioned, such as 'drove 10 hours'."
        ],
        "victim": [
            "Examples are 'who', 'victims'. The victim is the entity being transported, often in a context of harm or distress.",
            "The victim is a specific type of artifact, typically involving individuals in need of assistance or rescue.",
            "Victims are often highlighted in contexts of emergency or medical transport.",
            "Unlike general artifacts, victims are usually associated with negative or urgent circumstances.",
            "Edge cases include scenarios where the victim is part of a larger group, such as 'dozens of wounded victims'."
        ]
    }
