You are an expert in summarizing NLP event extraction guidelines. Your goal is to consolidate multiple detailed descriptions into a single concise, comprehensive "Advanced" guideline.

### Input Format ###
Event Type: Event Type Name
```json
{
  "Event Definition": [
    "Definition 1",
    "Definition 2",
    "Definition 3",
    "Definition 4",
    "Definition 5"
  ],
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    "Argument1": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    // Add additional arguments as necessary
  }
}
```

### Task ###
1. Consolidate the 5 definitions under "Event Definition" into a single definition:
   - Highlight all critical points and examples from the five definitions.
   - Ensure the description is concise, comprehensive, and clear, using formal language that non-experts can understand.

2. Do the same for each argument under "Arguments Definitions," producing a single advanced definition for each. 

### Output Format ###
```json
{
  "Event Definition": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the event type.",
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the mention argument.",
    "Argument1": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument1.",
    "Argument2": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument2."
    // Add additional arguments as applicable
  }
}
```

### Guidelines to Summarize ###
Event Type: prompt_Die(LifeEvent)
```json
{
    "Die(LifeEvent)": {
        "description": [
            "The event is triggered by the occurrence of a death, such as 'suicide', 'fallen', 'killed', 'death', 'deaths', or 'dead'.",
            "The event is characterized by the end of life of one or more individuals, often involving specific circumstances or causes.",
            "Unlike related events such as 'Injure' or 'Marry', this event specifically denotes the cessation of life, not injury or union.",
            "Triggers such as 'wounding' or 'marry' are indicative of 'Injure' or 'Marry' events, not the 'Die' event type.",
            "The outcome of this event is the confirmation of death, which can be caused by various means such as violence, accidents, or natural causes."
        ]
    },
    "attributes": {
        "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
        "agent": [
            "Examples are the entity responsible for causing the death, such as 'bomber' in 'A suicide bomber detonated explosives'.",
            "The agent is crucial in understanding the cause or perpetrator of the death event.",
            "In cases of accidents, the agent might be an inanimate object or natural force, e.g., 'earthquake' or 'fire'.",
            "Unlike the 'victim', the agent is the one who initiates the action leading to death.",
            "In some contexts, the agent might be implicit, such as 'disease' in 'He died of cancer'."
        ],
        "instrument": [
            "Examples are the means or tools used to cause the death, such as 'explosives' in 'A suicide bomber detonated explosives'.",
            "The instrument provides insight into the method of death, which can be critical for understanding the event.",
            "In cases of natural death, the instrument might be a condition or disease, e.g., 'cancer' or 'heart attack'.",
            "Unlike the 'agent', the instrument is the tool or method used by the agent to cause death.",
            "In some scenarios, the instrument might be abstract, such as 'poison' in 'He was poisoned'."
        ],
        "person": [
            "Examples are the individuals directly involved in the event, such as 'comrades' in 'bodies of fallen comrades'.",
            "The person argument is important for identifying who is affected by the death event.",
            "In some cases, the person might be a group or collective, e.g., 'soldiers' or 'civilians'.",
            "Unlike the 'victim', the person might not always be the one who dies but could be related to the event.",
            "In certain contexts, the person might be indirectly involved, such as 'family members' in 'He left behind a grieving family'."
        ],
        "place": [
            "Examples are the locations where the death occurs, such as 'mall' in 'A suicide bomber detonated explosives at the entrance to a crowded mall'.",
            "The place provides context and setting for the death event, which can be crucial for situational understanding.",
            "In some cases, the place might be a broader region, e.g., 'city' or 'country'.",
            "Unlike the 'agent' or 'instrument', the place is the physical location where the event transpires.",
            "In certain scenarios, the place might be implicit, such as 'home' in 'He died peacefully at home'."
        ],
        "victim": [
            "Examples are the individuals who die as a result of the event, such as 'bomber' in 'killing at least four shoppers and wounding 20'.",
            "The victim is central to the event as they are the ones who experience the cessation of life.",
            "In some cases, the victim might be a group or collective, e.g., 'people' or 'civilians'.",
            "Unlike the 'agent', the victim is the one who suffers the consequence of the death event.",
            "In certain contexts, the victim might be indirectly referenced, such as 'someone' in 'We are talking about someone's life or death'."
        ]
    }
