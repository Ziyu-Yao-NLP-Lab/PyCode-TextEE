You are an expert in synthesizing and summarizing detailed guidelines for NLP event extraction tasks. 
Your goal is to consolidate multiple detailed descriptions into one single, concise, and comprehensive "Advanced" guideline.

### Input ###
This is the input format:

Event Type: Event Type Name
```json
{
  "Event Definition": [
    "Definition 1",
    "Definition 2",
    "Definition 3",
    "Definition 4",
    "Definition 5"
  ],
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    "Argument1": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    // Add additional arguments as necessary
  }
}
```

### Task ###
1. Consolidate the five provided definitions under "Event Definition" into a single "Advanced" definition:
   - Combine all key points from the five definitions.
   - Ensure the description is concise, comprehensive, and clear.
   - Use formal language that non-experts can understand.

2. Consolidate the five provided definitions for each argument under "Arguments Definitions" into a single "Advanced" definition:
   - Highlight all critical points and examples from the five definitions.
   - Maintain clarity and precision.

### Output Format ###
```json
{
  "Event Definition": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the event type.",
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the mention argument.",
    "Argument1": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument1.",
    "Argument2": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument2."
    // Add additional arguments as applicable
  }
}
```

### Guidelines to Summarize ###
Event Type: prompt_Demonstrate(ConflictEvent)
```json
{
    "Demonstrate(ConflictEvent)": {
        "description": [
            "The event is triggered by actions or gatherings where people publicly express their opinions, often in opposition to something, such as 'rally', 'march', 'protests', or 'gathered'.",
            "The event is characterized by a collective action or assembly of individuals, typically involving a public display of dissent or support for a cause.",
            "Unlike an 'Attack' event, which involves physical violence or harm, a 'Demonstrate' event focuses on the act of public expression and assembly, even if it may lead to clashes or arrests.",
            "Triggers such as 'rally' and 'march' are indicative of a 'Demonstrate' event, not an 'Attack' event, which would involve terms like 'killed' or 'assaulted'.",
            "The outcomes of a 'Demonstrate' event include public visibility of the cause, potential clashes with authorities, and sometimes arrests, but not direct physical harm as seen in 'Attack' events."
        ]
    },
    "attributes": {
        "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
        "entity": [
            "Examples are 'protesters', 'people', 'demonstrators', 'Liana Owen', 'parents', and 'woman'. This argument identifies the individuals or groups participating in the demonstration.",
            "The 'entity' argument is crucial as it specifies who is involved in the demonstration, providing context to the event.",
            "In cases where the entity is a group, such as 'protesters' or 'demonstrators', it highlights the collective nature of the event.",
            "For individual participants, like 'Liana Owen' or 'woman', it personalizes the event, showing specific involvement.",
            "Edge cases include ambiguous references like 'their' which need to be clearly linked to the demonstrators to avoid confusion."
        ],
        "place": [
            "Examples are 'here', 'New York', 'city', 'Manhattan', 'White House', 'plazas', and 'streets'. This argument identifies the location where the demonstration takes place.",
            "The 'place' argument is important as it situates the event geographically, providing a setting for the demonstration.",
            "Locations can range from specific places like 'White House' to broader areas like 'city' or 'streets', indicating the scale of the event.",
            "In some cases, the place might be implied or need to be inferred from context, such as 'here' referring to the current location mentioned in the text.",
            "Edge cases include multiple locations like 'plazas' and 'streets', which should be annotated to reflect the spread of the demonstration."
        ]
    }
}
```
