You are an expert in synthesizing and summarizing detailed guidelines for NLP event extraction tasks. 
Your goal is to consolidate multiple detailed descriptions into one single, concise, and comprehensive "Advanced" guideline.

### Input ###
This is the input format:

Event Type: Event Type Name
```json
{
  "Event Definition": [
    "Definition 1",
    "Definition 2",
    "Definition 3",
    "Definition 4",
    "Definition 5"
  ],
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    "Argument1": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    // Add additional arguments as necessary
  }
}
```

### Task ###
1. Consolidate the five provided definitions under "Event Definition" into a single "Advanced" definition:
   - Combine all key points from the five definitions.
   - Ensure the description is concise, comprehensive, and clear.
   - Use formal language that non-experts can understand.

2. Consolidate the five provided definitions for each argument under "Arguments Definitions" into a single "Advanced" definition:
   - Highlight all critical points and examples from the five definitions.
   - Maintain clarity and precision.

### Output Format ###
```json
{
  "Event Definition": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the event type.",
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the mention argument.",
    "Argument1": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument1.",
    "Argument2": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument2."
    // Add additional arguments as applicable
  }
}
```

### Guidelines to Summarize ###
Event Type: prompt_TrialHearing(JusticeEvent)
```json
{
    "TrialHearing(JusticeEvent)": {
        "description": [
            "The event is triggered by legal proceedings where a case is being heard or tried in a court of law. Example triggers include 'hearing', 'trial', 'case', and 'tried'.",
            "The event is characterized by the presence of an adjudicator, a defendant, and often a prosecutor, and it takes place in a specific location such as a court or city.",
            "Unlike related events such as 'Appeal' or 'Sentence', this event focuses on the process of hearing or trying a case rather than the outcome or subsequent legal actions.",
            "Triggers such as 'appealed' or 'sentences' are indicative of 'Appeal' or 'Sentence' events, not this event type. The focus here is on the ongoing legal process.",
            "The outcome of this event is not the final judgment or sentence but the process of presenting evidence, arguments, and legal proceedings in front of an adjudicator."
        ]
    },
    "attributes": {
        "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
        "adjudicator": [
            "Examples are 'judge', 'court', or 'jury'. The adjudicator is the authority presiding over the trial or hearing, responsible for making legal decisions.",
            "The adjudicator's role is crucial as they ensure the trial or hearing is conducted fairly and according to the law. For instance, 'judge' in 'an oklahoma city judge has ruled'.",
            "In some cases, the adjudicator may be a panel or a specific court, such as 'Supreme Court' or 'District Court'.",
            "Unlike the 'prosecutor' or 'defendant', the adjudicator is neutral and does not represent either party in the trial or hearing.",
            "Edge cases include situations where the adjudicator is not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the context, such as 'the court said'."
        ],
        "defendant": [
            "Examples are 'nichols', 'Anwar Ibrahim', or 'Markovic'. The defendant is the individual or entity being tried or heard in the legal proceedings.",
            "The defendant's role is to respond to the charges or claims brought against them. For instance, 'nichols' in 'to try nichols on murder charges'.",
            "In some cases, there may be multiple defendants, such as 'officials' in 'Markovic will be tried along with 10 other Milosevic-era officials'.",
            "Unlike the 'prosecutor', the defendant is the party accused or charged in the trial or hearing.",
            "Edge cases include situations where the defendant is not explicitly named but can be inferred from the context, such as 'the wife' in 'Milosevic's wife will go on trial'."
        ],
        "place": [
            "Examples are 'oklahoma city', 'Belgrade', or 'New York'. The place is the location where the trial or hearing is taking place.",
            "The place is important as it provides context for the jurisdiction and legal authority overseeing the trial or hearing. For instance, 'oklahoma city' in 'an oklahoma city judge has ruled'.",
            "In some cases, the place may be a specific court or city, such as 'Belgrade district court' or 'federal court in New York'.",
            "Unlike the 'adjudicator' or 'defendant', the place is a geographical location and not a person or entity involved in the trial or hearing.",
            "Edge cases include situations where the place is not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the context, such as 'the court' in 'the court said'."
        ],
        "prosecutor": [
            "Examples are 'prosecutors', 'lawyer', or 'prosecution'. The prosecutor is the individual or entity presenting the case against the defendant in the trial or hearing.",
            "The prosecutor's role is to provide evidence and arguments to prove the defendant's guilt or liability. For instance, 'prosecutors' in 'prosecutors presented enough evidence'.",
            "In some cases, the prosecutor may be a specific individual or a team, such as 'lawyer' or 'prosecution'.",
            "Unlike the 'defendant', the prosecutor represents the state or the party bringing the charges or claims in the trial or hearing.",
            "Edge cases include situations where the prosecutor is not explicitly named but can be inferred from the context, such as 'the prosecution' in 'following an agreement with the prosecution'."
        ]
    }
