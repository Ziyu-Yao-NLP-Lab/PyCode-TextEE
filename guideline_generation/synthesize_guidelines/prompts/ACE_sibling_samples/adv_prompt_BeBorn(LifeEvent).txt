You are an expert in synthesizing and summarizing detailed guidelines for NLP event extraction tasks. 
Your goal is to consolidate multiple detailed descriptions into one single, concise, and comprehensive "Advanced" guideline.

### Input ###
This is the input format:

Event Type: Event Type Name
```json
{
  "Event Definition": [
    "Definition 1",
    "Definition 2",
    "Definition 3",
    "Definition 4",
    "Definition 5"
  ],
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    "Argument1": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    // Add additional arguments as necessary
  }
}
```

### Task ###
1. Consolidate the five provided definitions under "Event Definition" into a single "Advanced" definition:
   - Combine all key points from the five definitions.
   - Ensure the description is concise, comprehensive, and clear.
   - Use formal language that non-experts can understand.

2. Consolidate the five provided definitions for each argument under "Arguments Definitions" into a single "Advanced" definition:
   - Highlight all critical points and examples from the five definitions.
   - Maintain clarity and precision.

### Output Format ###
```json
{
  "Event Definition": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the event type.",
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the mention argument.",
    "Argument1": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument1.",
    "Argument2": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument2."
    // Add additional arguments as applicable
  }
}
```

### Guidelines to Summarize ###
Event Type: prompt_BeBorn(LifeEvent)
```json
{
    "BeBorn(LifeEvent)": {
        "description": [
            "The event is triggered by the birth or emergence of a person, typically indicated by terms such as 'born', 'birth', 'gave birth', 'removed', 'cut out', or 'having'.",
            "The event is characterized by the introduction of a new individual into the world, often specifying the person being born and sometimes the place of birth.",
            "Unlike other LifeEvents such as 'Die' or 'Marry', the BeBorn event specifically focuses on the beginning of life rather than its end or a significant life change.",
            "Triggers such as 'suicide', 'marry', or 'wounding' are indicative of other LifeEvents like 'Die', 'Marry', or 'Injure', not the BeBorn event type.",
            "The outcome of the BeBorn event is the existence of a new person, which is distinct from events like 'Die' where the outcome is the end of a life, or 'Marry' where the outcome is a change in marital status."
        ]
    },
    "attributes": {
        "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
        "person": [
            "Examples are 'babies', 'one', 'other', 'infant', 'Hunter', 'girl', 'baby', 'that', 'child', 'girls', 'boys'. This argument identifies the individual who is being born.",
            "The 'person' argument is crucial as it specifies the new individual introduced by the event. It can refer to a specific person or a general term like 'baby' or 'child'.",
            "In cases where multiple individuals are born, such as 'girls' and 'boys', each individual is considered a separate instance of the 'person' argument.",
            "Unlike the 'victim' argument in the 'Die' event, the 'person' argument in the BeBorn event refers to the new life rather than someone who has died.",
            "Edge cases include references to unborn individuals, such as 'fetus' or 'that', which still fall under the 'person' argument as they denote the entity being born."
        ],
        "place": [
            "Examples are 'home', 'New Zealand', 'nation'. This argument identifies the location where the birth takes place.",
            "The 'place' argument is important as it provides context to the event, indicating where the birth occurred.",
            "In some instances, the 'place' argument may be implicit or not explicitly mentioned, but when present, it adds significant detail to the event.",
            "Unlike the 'place' argument in the 'Die' event, which indicates where a death occurred, the 'place' argument in the BeBorn event specifies the location of birth.",
            "Edge cases include broad or non-specific locations like 'nation', which still qualify as the 'place' argument as they provide a general context for the birth."
        ]
    }
}
```
