You are an expert in synthesizing and summarizing detailed guidelines for NLP event extraction tasks. 
Your goal is to consolidate multiple detailed descriptions into one single, concise, and comprehensive "Advanced" guideline.

### Input ###
This is the input format:

Event Type: Event Type Name
```json
{
  "Event Definition": [
    "Definition 1",
    "Definition 2",
    "Definition 3",
    "Definition 4",
    "Definition 5"
  ],
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    "Argument1": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    // Add additional arguments as necessary
  }
}
```

### Task ###
1. Consolidate the five provided definitions under "Event Definition" into a single "Advanced" definition:
   - Combine all key points from the five definitions.
   - Ensure the description is concise, comprehensive, and clear.
   - Use formal language that non-experts can understand.

2. Consolidate the five provided definitions for each argument under "Arguments Definitions" into a single "Advanced" definition:
   - Highlight all critical points and examples from the five definitions.
   - Maintain clarity and precision.

### Output Format ###
```json
{
  "Event Definition": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the event type.",
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the mention argument.",
    "Argument1": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument1.",
    "Argument2": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument2."
    // Add additional arguments as applicable
  }
}
```

### Guidelines to Summarize ###
Event Type: prompt_Injure(LifeEvent)
```json
{
    "Injure(LifeEvent)": {
        "description": [
            "The event is triggered by actions or incidents that result in physical harm or injury to individuals. Example triggers include 'wounding', 'injured', 'harm', and 'injuries'.",
            "The event is characterized by the presence of a victim who suffers physical harm. Unlike the 'Die' event, the 'Injure' event does not necessarily result in death.",
            "The scope of the event includes any scenario where individuals are harmed, regardless of the severity of the injury. This can range from minor injuries to severe bodily harm.",
            "Triggers such as 'wounding' and 'injured' are indicative of the 'Injure' event type, not events like 'Marry' or 'BeBorn'.",
            "The outcomes of the 'Injure' event involve medical attention or treatment for the victims, distinguishing it from events like 'Divorce' or 'Marry' which do not involve physical harm."
        ]
    },
    "attributes": {
        "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
        "agent": [
            "Examples are the person or entity responsible for causing the injury. In the sentence 'A suicide bomber detonated explosives, wounding 20 people', the 'bomber' is the agent.",
            "The agent can be an individual, group, or even an abstract entity like 'terrorists' or 'forces'. For instance, 'forces' in 'The forces wounded several civilians' is the agent.",
            "In some cases, the agent may not be explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from context. For example, 'The explosion injured many' implies an agent responsible for the explosion.",
            "The agent is crucial for understanding the cause of the injury. Unlike the 'victim', the agent is the one inflicting harm.",
            "In negative examples, such as 'Hunter filed for divorce', there is no agent causing physical harm, thus it does not fit the 'Injure' event type."
        ],
        "instrument": [
            "Examples are the tools or means used to inflict injury. In 'A bomber detonated explosives, wounding 20 people', 'explosives' is the instrument.",
            "The instrument can be a weapon, object, or even a natural element like 'fire' or 'water'. For instance, 'gun' in 'He was injured by a gun' is the instrument.",
            "In some cases, the instrument may be implied rather than explicitly stated. For example, 'He was injured in the blast' implies an explosive device as the instrument.",
            "The instrument helps in understanding the method of injury. Unlike the 'agent', the instrument is the means through which harm is caused.",
            "In negative examples, such as 'She gave birth at home', there is no instrument causing injury, thus it does not fit the 'Injure' event type."
        ],
        "place": [
            "Examples are the locations where the injury occurs. In 'A bomber detonated explosives at a mall, wounding 20 people', 'mall' is the place.",
            "The place can be a specific location like 'airport', 'school', or 'hospital'. For instance, 'airport' in 'People were wounded at the airport' is the place.",
            "In some cases, the place may be a broader area like 'city' or 'region'. For example, 'city' in 'Many were injured in the city' is the place.",
            "The place provides context for where the injury event took place. Unlike the 'agent' or 'instrument', the place is the setting of the event.",
            "In negative examples, such as 'She married at home', the place is not associated with an injury, thus it does not fit the 'Injure' event type."
        ],
        "victim": [
            "Examples are the individuals who suffer the injury. In 'A bomber detonated explosives, wounding 20 people', '20 people' are the victims.",
            "The victim can be a single person or multiple individuals. For instance, 'children' in 'Children were injured in the blast' are the victims.",
            "In some cases, the victim may be described in terms of their role or identity, such as 'civilians', 'soldiers', or 'students'. For example, 'civilians' in 'Civilians were injured' are the victims.",
            "The victim is crucial for identifying who is affected by the injury. Unlike the 'agent', the victim is the one receiving harm.",
            "In negative examples, such as 'She filed for divorce', there is no victim suffering physical harm, thus it does not fit the 'Injure' event type."
        ]
    }
