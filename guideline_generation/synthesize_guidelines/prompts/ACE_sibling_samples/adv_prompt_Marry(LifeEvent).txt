You are an expert in synthesizing and summarizing detailed guidelines for NLP event extraction tasks. 
Your goal is to consolidate multiple detailed descriptions into one single, concise, and comprehensive "Advanced" guideline.

### Input ###
This is the input format:

Event Type: Event Type Name
```json
{
  "Event Definition": [
    "Definition 1",
    "Definition 2",
    "Definition 3",
    "Definition 4",
    "Definition 5"
  ],
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    "Argument1": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    // Add additional arguments as necessary
  }
}
```

### Task ###
1. Consolidate the five provided definitions under "Event Definition" into a single "Advanced" definition:
   - Combine all key points from the five definitions.
   - Ensure the description is concise, comprehensive, and clear.
   - Use formal language that non-experts can understand.

2. Consolidate the five provided definitions for each argument under "Arguments Definitions" into a single "Advanced" definition:
   - Highlight all critical points and examples from the five definitions.
   - Maintain clarity and precision.

### Output Format ###
```json
{
  "Event Definition": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the event type.",
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the mention argument.",
    "Argument1": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument1.",
    "Argument2": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument2."
    // Add additional arguments as applicable
  }
}
```

### Guidelines to Summarize ###
Event Type: prompt_Marry(LifeEvent)
```json
{
    "Marry(LifeEvent)": {
        "description": [
            "The event is triggered by the act of entering into a marriage or wedding ceremony. Example triggers include 'marry', 'marriage', 'wedding', 'married', and 'wed'.",
            "The event is characterized by the formal union of two individuals in a recognized relationship, typically involving a ceremony. It encompasses both the act of getting married and the state of being married.",
            "Unlike the Divorce event, which signifies the dissolution of a marriage, the Marry event signifies the formation or existence of a marital union. Triggers such as 'divorce' are indicative of the Divorce event, not the Marry event.",
            "The Marry event can occur in various contexts, including traditional ceremonies, legal unions, and informal commitments. It is not limited to any specific cultural or religious practices.",
            "The outcomes of the Marry event include the establishment of a legally or socially recognized partnership. This event is distinct from other LifeEvents such as BeBorn or Die, which mark the beginning and end of life, respectively."
        ]
    },
    "attributes": {
        "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
        "person": [
            "Examples are 'daughter', 'Raja Ahmad Sharir Iskandar', 'their', 'whom', 'she', 'Stewart', 'Alana Hamilton', 'she', 'Welch', 'Welches', 'Rudolph Giuliani', 'companion'. This argument identifies the individuals involved in the marriage.",
            "The 'person' argument is crucial as it specifies the participants in the marital union. It can refer to one or both individuals getting married.",
            "In cases where the text refers to multiple people, such as 'Stewart and Alana Hamilton', both names should be annotated as 'person'.",
            "The 'person' argument can also include pronouns like 'she', 'he', 'they', which refer to the individuals involved in the marriage.",
            "Edge cases include references to individuals by their roles or relationships, such as 'daughter' or 'companion'. These should be annotated as 'person' when they clearly indicate the individuals getting married."
        ],
        "place": [
            "Examples are 'home', 'Gracie Mansion'. This argument identifies the location where the marriage or wedding ceremony takes place.",
            "The 'place' argument is important as it provides context about the setting of the marriage event. It can refer to specific venues, cities, or even countries.",
            "In cases where the location is implied but not explicitly stated, such as 'at her parents' house', the implied location should be annotated as 'place'.",
            "The 'place' argument can include both formal venues like 'church' or 'court' and informal settings like 'home' or 'beach'.",
            "Edge cases include references to locations that are part of a larger event, such as 'wedding in Paris'. Here, 'Paris' should be annotated as 'place'."
        ]
    }
}
```
