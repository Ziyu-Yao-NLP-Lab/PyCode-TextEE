You are an expert in synthesizing and summarizing detailed guidelines for NLP event extraction tasks. 
Your goal is to consolidate multiple detailed descriptions into one single, concise, and comprehensive "Advanced" guideline.

### Input ###
This is the input format:

Event Type: Event Type Name
```json
{
  "Event Definition": [
    "Definition 1",
    "Definition 2",
    "Definition 3",
    "Definition 4",
    "Definition 5"
  ],
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    "Argument1": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    // Add additional arguments as necessary
  }
}
```

### Task ###
1. Consolidate the five provided definitions under "Event Definition" into a single "Advanced" definition:
   - Combine all key points from the five definitions.
   - Ensure the description is concise, comprehensive, and clear.
   - Use formal language that non-experts can understand.

2. Consolidate the five provided definitions for each argument under "Arguments Definitions" into a single "Advanced" definition:
   - Highlight all critical points and examples from the five definitions.
   - Maintain clarity and precision.

### Output Format ###
```json
{
  "Event Definition": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the event type.",
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the mention argument.",
    "Argument1": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument1.",
    "Argument2": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument2."
    // Add additional arguments as applicable
  }
}
```

### Guidelines to Summarize ###
Event Type: prompt_Appeal(JusticeEvent)
```json
{
    "Appeal(JusticeEvent)": {
        "description": [
            "The event is triggered by an individual or group formally requesting a higher court to review and change the decision of a lower court. Example triggers include 'appealed', 'appeals', and 'appeal'.",
            "The event is characterized by the involvement of a plaintiff who seeks a review of a legal decision, often involving an adjudicator such as a court or judge. The scope includes legal contexts where decisions are contested.",
            "Unlike the 'Execute' event, which involves carrying out a sentence, the 'Appeal' event focuses on challenging and potentially overturning a decision. Triggers like 'executed' are indicative of the 'Execute' event, not the 'Appeal' event.",
            "The 'Appeal' event differs from the 'ChargeIndict' event, which involves formally accusing someone of a crime. Triggers such as 'charges' are indicative of the 'ChargeIndict' event, not the 'Appeal' event.",
            "The outcome of an 'Appeal' event can lead to a decision being upheld, overturned, or modified, which is distinct from events like 'Convict' or 'Sentence' where the focus is on the initial judgment and punishment."
        ]
    },
    "attributes": {
        "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
        "adjudicator": [
            "Examples are 'Supreme Court', 'court', 'Federal Court'. The adjudicator is the authority or body that reviews the appeal and makes a decision on it.",
            "The adjudicator plays a crucial role in the appeal process, as their decision can uphold, overturn, or modify the original ruling. For instance, 'Supreme Court' in 'appealed to the Supreme Court'.",
            "In some cases, the adjudicator may be a specific judge or panel of judges. For example, 'pre-selected judges' in 'its pre-selected judges, most junior of the court of appeal'.",
            "The adjudicator is distinct from the plaintiff, who is the party requesting the appeal. For example, 'Federal Court' in 'appeal to the country's highest Federal Court'.",
            "Unlike the 'prosecutor' in a 'ChargeIndict' event, the adjudicator in an 'Appeal' event is not advocating for a particular outcome but rather reviewing the case impartially. For example, 'court' in 'taken to the appeal court'."
        ],
        "place": [
            "Examples are 'Indonesia', 'court', 'Federal Court'. The place is the location where the appeal is filed or reviewed.",
            "The place can be a country, city, or specific court where the legal proceedings occur. For instance, 'Indonesia' in 'appealed to the Supreme Court for a second review'.",
            "In some contexts, the place may refer to the jurisdiction or legal body overseeing the appeal. For example, 'court' in 'taken to the appeal court'.",
            "The place is important for understanding the legal context and jurisdiction of the appeal. For example, 'Federal Court' in 'appeal to the country's highest Federal Court'.",
            "Unlike the 'origin' or 'destination' in an 'Extradite' event, the place in an 'Appeal' event is where the legal review takes place. For example, 'court' in 'appeal to the court'."
        ],
        "plaintiff": [
            "Examples are 'five', 'their', 'offender'. The plaintiff is the individual or group requesting the appeal.",
            "The plaintiff is the party that believes the original decision was incorrect and seeks a review. For instance, 'five' in 'five of them appealed to the Supreme Court'.",
            "In some cases, the plaintiff may be referred to by a pronoun or a general term. For example, 'their' in 'their appeals for a review'.",
            "The plaintiff is distinct from the adjudicator, who reviews the appeal. For example, 'offender' in 'the sixth offender has only made one appeal'.",
            "Unlike the 'defendant' in a 'ChargeIndict' event, the plaintiff in an 'Appeal' event is actively seeking a change in the legal decision. For example, 'convict' in 'a convict can file a case review or appeal'."
        ]
    }
