You are an expert in synthesizing and summarizing detailed guidelines for NLP event extraction tasks. 
Your goal is to consolidate multiple detailed descriptions into one single, concise, and comprehensive "Advanced" guideline.

### Input ###
This is the input format:

Event Type: Event Type Name
```json
{
  "Event Definition": [
    "Definition 1",
    "Definition 2",
    "Definition 3",
    "Definition 4",
    "Definition 5"
  ],
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    "Argument1": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    // Add additional arguments as necessary
  }
}
```

### Task ###
1. Consolidate the five provided definitions under "Event Definition" into a single "Advanced" definition:
   - Combine all key points from the five definitions.
   - Ensure the description is concise, comprehensive, and clear.
   - Use formal language that non-experts can understand.

2. Consolidate the five provided definitions for each argument under "Arguments Definitions" into a single "Advanced" definition:
   - Highlight all critical points and examples from the five definitions.
   - Maintain clarity and precision.

### Output Format ###
```json
{
  "Event Definition": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the event type.",
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the mention argument.",
    "Argument1": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument1.",
    "Argument2": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument2."
    // Add additional arguments as applicable
  }
}
```

### Guidelines to Summarize ###
Event Type: prompt_Sentence(JusticeEvent)
```json
{
    "Sentence(JusticeEvent)": {
        "description": [
            "The event is triggered by the imposition of a judicial sentence on a defendant by an adjudicator. Example triggers include 'sentenced', 'sentence', and 'handed out sentences'.",
            "The event is characterized by the formal declaration of a punishment or penalty by a court or judge. It involves the adjudicator (e.g., court, judge) and the defendant (e.g., individual, group) who is being sentenced.",
            "The scope of the event includes any legal context where a sentence is imposed, such as criminal cases, civil penalties, and administrative rulings. It does not include events where the sentence is merely discussed or anticipated without formal imposition.",
            "Unlike related events such as 'Acquit' or 'Appeal', the 'Sentence' event specifically involves the final decision to impose a penalty. Triggers like 'acquitted' or 'appealed' indicate different stages or outcomes in the judicial process.",
            "Triggers and outcomes for the 'Sentence' event differ from events like 'Fine' or 'ReleaseParole'. For instance, 'fine' involves a monetary penalty without necessarily involving imprisonment, while 'release' involves freeing a person from custody, not imposing a new penalty."
        ]
    },
    "attributes": {
        "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
        "adjudicator": [
            "Examples are 'court', 'judge', 'Supreme Court'. The adjudicator is the authority that imposes the sentence. It is crucial as it represents the legal body making the decision.",
            "The adjudicator can be a specific judge or a collective body like a jury or a court. For instance, 'the jury' in 'the jury sentenced the defendant' is the adjudicator.",
            "In some cases, the adjudicator might be implied rather than explicitly stated. For example, 'he was sentenced to life imprisonment' implies a judicial authority.",
            "Edge cases include situations where the adjudicator is a higher court upholding a lower court's sentence, such as 'the Supreme Court upheld the sentence'.",
            "Unlike the 'prosecutor' or 'defense attorney', the adjudicator is neutral and authoritative, making the final decision on the sentence."
        ],
        "defendant": [
            "Examples are 'smugglers', 'billionaire', 'convict', 'Anwar Ibrahim'. The defendant is the individual or group being sentenced. This argument is essential as it identifies who is receiving the sentence.",
            "The defendant can be a person or an entity, such as a corporation. For instance, 'the company was sentenced to pay a fine' identifies the defendant as the company.",
            "In some contexts, the defendant might be referred to by a pronoun, such as 'he' or 'they'. For example, 'he was sentenced to five years' refers to the defendant.",
            "Edge cases include situations where the defendant is part of a larger group, such as 'the members of the gang were sentenced'. Each member is a defendant.",
            "Unlike the 'plaintiff' or 'victim', the defendant is the party against whom the sentence is imposed, often following a conviction or guilty plea."
        ],
        "place": [
            "Examples are 'Indonesian', 'province', 'court'. The place indicates the location where the sentence is imposed. It is important as it provides context and jurisdiction.",
            "The place can be a country, city, or specific court. For instance, 'the New York court' specifies the place as New York.",
            "In some cases, the place might be implied through context, such as 'the local court sentenced him', where 'local' implies a specific but unnamed place.",
            "Edge cases include situations where the place is a higher court reviewing a sentence from a lower court, such as 'the federal court upheld the sentence from the state court'.",
            "Unlike the 'origin' or 'destination' in events like 'Extradite', the place in a 'Sentence' event is where the judicial decision is made, not where the defendant is moved to or from."
        ]
    }
