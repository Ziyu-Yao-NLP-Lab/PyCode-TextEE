You are an expert in synthesizing and summarizing detailed guidelines for NLP event extraction tasks. 
Your goal is to consolidate multiple detailed descriptions into one single, concise, and comprehensive "Advanced" guideline.

### Input ###
This is the input format:

Event Type: Event Type Name
```json
{
  "Event Definition": [
    "Definition 1",
    "Definition 2",
    "Definition 3",
    "Definition 4",
    "Definition 5"
  ],
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    "Argument1": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    // Add additional arguments as necessary
  }
}
```

### Task ###
1. Consolidate the five provided definitions under "Event Definition" into a single "Advanced" definition:
   - Combine all key points from the five definitions.
   - Ensure the description is concise, comprehensive, and clear.
   - Use formal language that non-experts can understand.

2. Consolidate the five provided definitions for each argument under "Arguments Definitions" into a single "Advanced" definition:
   - Highlight all critical points and examples from the five definitions.
   - Maintain clarity and precision.

### Output Format ###
```json
{
  "Event Definition": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the event type.",
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the mention argument.",
    "Argument1": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument1.",
    "Argument2": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument2."
    // Add additional arguments as applicable
  }
}
```

### Guidelines to Summarize ###
Event Type: prompt_TransferOwnership(TransactionEvent)
```json
{
    "TransferOwnership(TransactionEvent)": {
        "description": [
            "The event is triggered by the transfer of ownership of an artifact from one entity to another. Example triggers include 'sell', 'buy', 'acquire', and 'provide'.",
            "The event is characterized by the change in possession or control of an artifact, typically involving a seller and a buyer. Unlike TransferMoney, this event involves physical or intellectual property rather than monetary transactions.",
            "The event scope includes any transaction where an artifact is transferred, regardless of the medium or context. For instance, 'selling a business' or 'acquiring a property' are within scope.",
            "Triggers such as 'donate' or 'gift' are indicative of TransferOwnership, not TransferMoney, as they involve the transfer of tangible or intangible assets rather than funds.",
            "The outcome of this event type is the change in ownership of the artifact, distinguishing it from events like TransferMoney where the primary outcome is the transfer of funds."
        ]
    },
    "attributes": {
        "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
        "artifact": [
            "Examples are 'apartment', 'operations', 'hotel', 'property', 'business', 'parks', 'division'. The artifact is the item or entity being transferred in the event.",
            "The artifact is crucial as it represents the object of the transaction. It can be tangible like 'property' or intangible like 'operations'.",
            "In domain-specific contexts, the artifact could be specialized, such as 'nuclear weapons' in a geopolitical scenario or 'shares' in a financial transaction.",
            "Edge cases include scenarios where the artifact is not explicitly mentioned but implied, such as 'selling everything' where 'everything' needs to be inferred.",
            "Unlike TransferMoney, where the focus is on the amount, TransferOwnership focuses on the specific item or entity being transferred."
        ],
        "beneficiary": [
            "Examples are 'nanny'. The beneficiary is the entity that benefits from the transfer, often receiving the artifact.",
            "The beneficiary is important as it identifies who gains from the transaction, which can be an individual or an organization.",
            "In some cases, the beneficiary might not be directly involved in the transaction but still receives the benefits, such as 'a charity' receiving a donated artifact.",
            "Edge cases include scenarios where the beneficiary is a group or community, such as 'residents' benefiting from a transferred public asset.",
            "Unlike the buyer, the beneficiary does not necessarily provide compensation for the artifact; they simply receive the benefits."
        ],
        "buyer": [
            "Examples are 'company', 'Andrew Harris', 'firm', 'Blackstone Group'. The buyer is the entity that acquires the artifact in exchange for compensation.",
            "The buyer is essential as it represents the party gaining ownership of the artifact, often providing monetary or other forms of compensation.",
            "In domain-specific contexts, the buyer could be a corporate entity, an individual, or a government body, depending on the nature of the transaction.",
            "Edge cases include scenarios where the buyer is a consortium or partnership, such as 'a group of investors' acquiring a business.",
            "Unlike the beneficiary, the buyer is actively involved in the transaction and provides compensation for the artifact."
        ],
        "place": [
            "Examples are 'Belgrade'. The place is the location where the transfer of ownership occurs or where the artifact is situated.",
            "The place is significant as it provides context to the transaction, indicating where the transfer is taking place or where the artifact is located.",
            "In domain-specific contexts, the place could be a specific address, a city, or even a virtual location in the case of digital assets.",
            "Edge cases include scenarios where the place is not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the context, such as 'the headquarters' implying the company's main office.",
            "Unlike the artifact, which is the item being transferred, the place provides the geographical or situational context of the transfer."
        ],
        "seller": [
            "Examples are 'Mirjana Markovic', 'USA Interactive', 'Vivendi', 'group'. The seller is the entity that transfers ownership of the artifact in exchange for compensation.",
            "The seller is crucial as it represents the party relinquishing ownership of the artifact, often receiving monetary or other forms of compensation.",
            "In domain-specific contexts, the seller could be an individual, a corporation, or a government entity, depending on the nature of the transaction.",
            "Edge cases include scenarios where the seller is a consortium or partnership, such as 'a group of shareholders' selling their stakes.",
            "Unlike the buyer, the seller is the party that initiates the transfer of ownership and receives compensation for the artifact."
        ]
    }
}
