You are an expert in summarizing NLP event extraction guidelines. Your goal is to consolidate multiple detailed descriptions into a single concise, comprehensive "Advanced" guideline.

### Input Format ###
Event Type: Event Type Name
```json
{
  "Event Definition": [
    "Definition 1",
    "Definition 2",
    "Definition 3",
    "Definition 4",
    "Definition 5"
  ],
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    "Argument1": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    // Add additional arguments as necessary
  }
}
```

### Task ###
1. Consolidate the 5 definitions under "Event Definition" into a single definition:
   - Highlight all critical points and examples from the five definitions.
   - Ensure the description is concise, comprehensive, and clear, using formal language that non-experts can understand.

2. Do the same for each argument under "Arguments Definitions," producing a single advanced definition for each. 

### Output Format ###
```json
{
  "Event Definition": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the event type.",
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the mention argument.",
    "Argument1": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument1.",
    "Argument2": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument2."
    // Add additional arguments as applicable
  }
}
```

### Guidelines to Summarize ###
Event Type: prompt_Fine(JusticeEvent)
```json
{
    "Fine(JusticeEvent)": {
        "description": [
            "The event is triggered by the imposition of a monetary penalty on an individual or entity as a result of a legal judgment or ruling. Example triggers include 'fines', 'fined', 'return', and 'judgments'.",
            "The event is characterized by the requirement for the entity to pay a specified amount of money as a penalty for a legal violation. This distinguishes it from other JusticeEvents like 'Sentence' or 'ArrestJail', which may involve imprisonment or other forms of punishment.",
            "Unlike 'Extradite' or 'Execute', the Fine event does not involve the physical relocation or execution of the entity. Instead, it focuses solely on the financial penalty imposed.",
            "Triggers such as 'extradite' or 'execute' are indicative of 'Extradite' or 'Execute' events, not the Fine event type. The Fine event is specifically about financial penalties.",
            "The outcome of the Fine event is the payment or obligation to pay a monetary amount, which differs from outcomes like imprisonment (Sentence) or physical relocation (Extradite)."
        ]
    },
    "attributes": {
        "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
        "adjudicator": [
            "Examples are 'Supreme Court', 'court', or 'judge'. The adjudicator is the authority or legal body that imposes the fine.",
            "The adjudicator's role is crucial as they are responsible for determining the fine based on legal proceedings. For instance, 'The court fined the defendant $5000'.",
            "In cases where the adjudicator is not explicitly mentioned, it can be inferred from the context, such as 'The ruling imposed a fine' where the ruling implies a legal authority.",
            "Unlike the 'agent' in events like 'ArrestJail', the adjudicator in a Fine event does not physically enforce the penalty but rather issues the legal mandate for the fine.",
            "Edge cases include situations where the adjudicator is a collective body, such as 'The National Assembly passed a bill imposing fines'. Here, the legislative body acts as the adjudicator."
        ],
        "entity": [
            "Examples are 'dictator', 'Chun', 'people', 'man', 'officials', 'father', 'Roh', 'his'. The entity is the individual or group that is subjected to the fine.",
            "The entity's role is to be the recipient of the fine, meaning they are the ones who must pay the monetary penalty. For example, 'The company was fined $1 million'.",
            "In some cases, the entity may be a collective group or organization, such as 'The corporation was fined for environmental violations'.",
            "Unlike the 'defendant' in events like 'Convict' or 'Acquit', the entity in a Fine event is specifically tied to the financial penalty rather than the broader legal judgment.",
            "Edge cases include situations where the entity is not explicitly named but can be inferred, such as 'He was fined $200' where 'he' refers to the entity."
        ],
        "place": [
            "Examples are 'South Korea', 'Salonika', 'Massachusetts'. The place is the location where the fine is imposed or relevant to the legal proceedings.",
            "The place's role is to provide context for the jurisdiction or location of the legal authority imposing the fine. For instance, 'The court in New York fined the company'.",
            "In some cases, the place may refer to the broader region or country, such as 'The government of South Korea imposed fines'.",
            "Unlike the 'origin' or 'destination' in events like 'Extradite', the place in a Fine event is not about movement but rather the location of the legal action.",
            "Edge cases include situations where the place is implied rather than explicitly stated, such as 'The local authorities imposed a fine' where 'local' implies a specific place."
        ]
    }
