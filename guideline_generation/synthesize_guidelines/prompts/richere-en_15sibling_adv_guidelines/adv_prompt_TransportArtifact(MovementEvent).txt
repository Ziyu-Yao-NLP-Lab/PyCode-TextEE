You are an expert in summarizing NLP event extraction guidelines. Your goal is to consolidate multiple detailed descriptions into a single concise, comprehensive "Advanced" guideline.

### Input Format ###
Event Type: Event Type Name
```json
{
  "Event Definition": [
    "Definition 1",
    "Definition 2",
    "Definition 3",
    "Definition 4",
    "Definition 5"
  ],
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    "Argument1": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    // Add additional arguments as necessary
  }
}
```

### Task ###
1. Consolidate the 5 definitions under "Event Definition" into a single definition:
   - Highlight all critical points and examples from the five definitions.
   - Ensure the description is concise, comprehensive, and clear, using formal language that non-experts can understand.

2. Do the same for each argument under "Arguments Definitions," producing a single advanced definition for each. 

### Output Format ###
```json
{
  "Event Definition": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the event type.",
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the mention argument.",
    "Argument1": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument1.",
    "Argument2": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument2."
    // Add additional arguments as applicable
  }
}
```

### Guidelines to Summarize ###
Event Type: prompt_TransportArtifact(MovementEvent)
```json
{
    "TransportArtifact(MovementEvent)": {
        "description": [
            "The event is triggered by the movement or transportation of an artifact from one location to another. Example triggers include 'bring', 'deliver', 'take', and 'pull'.",
            "The event is characterized by the involvement of an agent who facilitates the movement, an artifact being moved, and often includes the origin and destination locations.",
            "Unlike TransportPerson events, which involve the movement of individuals, TransportArtifact events specifically involve the movement of objects or items.",
            "Triggers such as 'relocate' are indicative of TransportPerson events, not TransportArtifact events, as they imply the movement of people rather than objects.",
            "The outcome of a TransportArtifact event is the successful or attempted relocation of an artifact, which can be contrasted with the movement of people in TransportPerson events."
        ]
    },
    "attributes": {
        "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
        "agent": [
            "Examples are 'STUDENTS' in 'STUDENTS can bring GUNS to school', indicating the entity responsible for the transportation.",
            "The agent is the entity that initiates or carries out the movement of the artifact. For instance, 'Amtrak' in 'Amtrak are delivering it'.",
            "In some cases, the agent may be implied or indirectly referenced, such as 'we' in 'we're not allowed to leave it with a neighbour'.",
            "The agent can be an individual, group, or organization, as seen in 'locals' in 'locals took all of my money and guns'.",
            "Unlike the artifact, the agent is the active participant in the event, responsible for the action of moving the artifact."
        ],
        "artifact": [
            "Examples are 'GUNS' in 'STUDENTS can bring GUNS to school', indicating the item being transported.",
            "The artifact is the object or item that is being moved from one location to another. For example, 'the truck' in 'the truck pulled away from a cafe'.",
            "Artifacts can vary widely in nature, from physical objects like 'guns' to larger items like 'the truck'.",
            "In some contexts, the artifact may be implied or part of a larger set of items, such as 'it' in 'we're not allowed to leave it with a neighbour'.",
            "Unlike the agent, the artifact is the passive participant in the event, being moved rather than moving itself."
        ],
        "destination": [
            "Examples are 'school' in 'STUDENTS can bring GUNS to school', indicating the endpoint of the transportation.",
            "The destination is the location to which the artifact is being transported. For instance, 'door' in 'it had been delivered next door'.",
            "Destinations can be specific places, such as 'cafe' or more general locations like 'home'.",
            "In some cases, the destination may be implied or understood from context, such as 'next door' in 'it had been delivered next door'.",
            "Unlike the origin, the destination is the endpoint of the movement, where the artifact is intended to arrive."
        ],
        "origin": [
            "Examples are 'cafe' in 'the truck pulled away from a cafe', indicating the starting point of the transportation.",
            "The origin is the location from which the artifact is being moved. For example, 'place' in 'relocate from one place to another'.",
            "Origins can be specific places, such as 'cafe', or more general locations like 'home'.",
            "In some contexts, the origin may be implied or understood from context, such as 'home' in 'arrived home yesterday'.",
            "Unlike the destination, the origin is the starting point of the movement, where the artifact begins its journey."
        ]
    }
