You are an expert in summarizing NLP event extraction guidelines. Your goal is to consolidate multiple detailed descriptions into a single concise, comprehensive "Advanced" guideline.

### Input Format ###
Event Type: Event Type Name
```json
{
  "Event Definition": [
    "Definition 1",
    "Definition 2",
    "Definition 3",
    "Definition 4",
    "Definition 5"
  ],
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    "Argument1": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    // Add additional arguments as necessary
  }
}
```

### Task ###
1. Consolidate the 5 definitions under "Event Definition" into a single definition:
   - Highlight all critical points and examples from the five definitions.
   - Ensure the description is concise, comprehensive, and clear, using formal language that non-experts can understand.

2. Do the same for each argument under "Arguments Definitions," producing a single advanced definition for each. 

### Output Format ###
```json
{
  "Event Definition": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the event type.",
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the mention argument.",
    "Argument1": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument1.",
    "Argument2": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument2."
    // Add additional arguments as applicable
  }
}
```

### Guidelines to Summarize ###
Event Type: prompt_Sue(JusticeEvent)
```json
{
    "Sue(JusticeEvent)": {
        "description": [
            "The event is triggered by legal actions where one party initiates a lawsuit against another. Example triggers include 'sue', 'lawsuit', 'court', and 'civil suit'.",
            "The event is characterized by the involvement of a plaintiff who brings the case, a defendant who is being sued, and sometimes an adjudicator who oversees the case. The place where the lawsuit occurs can also be specified.",
            "Unlike other JusticeEvent types such as 'Execute' or 'ArrestJail', the 'Sue' event does not involve criminal prosecution or physical detention but focuses on civil legal disputes.",
            "Triggers such as 'charged' or 'convicted' are indicative of criminal proceedings and are not related to the 'Sue' event type, which deals with civil litigation.",
            "The outcome of a 'Sue' event typically involves a legal judgment or settlement, whereas events like 'Pardon' or 'ReleaseParole' involve decisions on criminal sentences or detentions."
        ]
    },
    "attributes": {
        "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
        "adjudicator": [
            "Examples are 'court', 'judge', or 'jury'. The adjudicator is the entity responsible for overseeing the legal proceedings and making a judgment.",
            "The adjudicator plays a crucial role in ensuring the legal process is fair and just. For instance, 'The court ruled in favor of the plaintiff'.",
            "In some cases, the adjudicator may be a specific judge or a panel of judges. For example, 'Judge Smith presided over the case'.",
            "Unlike the 'defendant' or 'plaintiff', the adjudicator is neutral and does not have a vested interest in the outcome of the case.",
            "Edge cases include situations where the adjudicator is not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the context, such as 'The lawsuit was settled in court'."
        ],
        "defendant": [
            "Examples are 'the company', 'the individual', or 'the organization'. The defendant is the party being sued in the legal action.",
            "The defendant is crucial as they are the target of the lawsuit and their actions or inactions are being challenged. For instance, 'The company was sued for breach of contract'.",
            "In some cases, the defendant may be a group of individuals or entities. For example, 'The banks were sued for fraudulent practices'.",
            "Unlike the 'plaintiff', the defendant is on the receiving end of the legal action and must respond to the allegations.",
            "Edge cases include situations where the defendant is not explicitly named but can be inferred, such as 'They sued for damages'."
        ],
        "place": [
            "Examples are 'England', 'New York', or 'the local court'. The place indicates the location where the lawsuit is filed or adjudicated.",
            "The place is important as it can influence the legal jurisdiction and applicable laws. For instance, 'The lawsuit was filed in California'.",
            "In some cases, the place may refer to a specific court or legal venue. For example, 'The case was heard in the Supreme Court'.",
            "Unlike other arguments, the place provides geographical context and does not directly involve the parties in the lawsuit.",
            "Edge cases include situations where the place is not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the context, such as 'The lawsuit was filed locally'."
        ],
        "plaintiff": [
            "Examples are 'the authors', 'the union', or 'the family'. The plaintiff is the party initiating the lawsuit.",
            "The plaintiff is crucial as they are the ones bringing the legal action and seeking a remedy. For instance, 'The authors sued for copyright infringement'.",
            "In some cases, the plaintiff may be a group of individuals or entities. For example, 'The union sued the company for unfair labor practices'.",
            "Unlike the 'defendant', the plaintiff is the one making the allegations and seeking legal redress.",
            "Edge cases include situations where the plaintiff is not explicitly named but can be inferred, such as 'They filed a lawsuit'."
        ]
    }
}
