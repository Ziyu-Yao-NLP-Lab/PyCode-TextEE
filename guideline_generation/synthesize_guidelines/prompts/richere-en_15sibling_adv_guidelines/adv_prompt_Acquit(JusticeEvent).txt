You are an expert in summarizing NLP event extraction guidelines. Your goal is to consolidate multiple detailed descriptions into a single concise, comprehensive "Advanced" guideline.

### Input Format ###
Event Type: Event Type Name
```json
{
  "Event Definition": [
    "Definition 1",
    "Definition 2",
    "Definition 3",
    "Definition 4",
    "Definition 5"
  ],
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    "Argument1": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    // Add additional arguments as necessary
  }
}
```

### Task ###
1. Consolidate the 5 definitions under "Event Definition" into a single definition:
   - Highlight all critical points and examples from the five definitions.
   - Ensure the description is concise, comprehensive, and clear, using formal language that non-experts can understand.

2. Do the same for each argument under "Arguments Definitions," producing a single advanced definition for each. 

### Output Format ###
```json
{
  "Event Definition": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the event type.",
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the mention argument.",
    "Argument1": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument1.",
    "Argument2": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument2."
    // Add additional arguments as applicable
  }
}
```

### Guidelines to Summarize ###
Event Type: prompt_Acquit(JusticeEvent)
```json
{
    "Acquit(JusticeEvent)": {
        "description": [
            "The event is triggered by a legal decision where a defendant is declared not guilty of the charges against them. Example triggers include 'acquitted', 'cleared of', 'exonerated', 'overturned', and 'dropped'.",
            "The event is characterized by the formal release of a defendant from legal charges, often following a trial or legal review. Key characteristics include the involvement of a legal authority (adjudicator) and the defendant being the subject of the decision.",
            "Unlike the 'Convict' event, which results in a guilty verdict, the 'Acquit' event results in a not guilty verdict. Triggers such as 'convicted' are indicative of the 'Convict' event type, not the 'Acquit' event type.",
            "The 'Acquit' event differs from the 'Pardon' event in that an acquittal occurs when a defendant is found not guilty, whereas a pardon is an act of forgiveness for a crime that was committed. Triggers such as 'pardoned' are indicative of the 'Pardon' event type, not the 'Acquit' event type.",
            "The outcome of the 'Acquit' event is the defendant being freed from legal charges, whereas the 'Appeal' event involves a request for a higher court to review the decision of a lower court. Triggers such as 'appealed' are indicative of the 'Appeal' event type, not the 'Acquit' event type."
        ]
    },
    "attributes": {
        "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
        "adjudicator": [
            "The adjudicator is the legal authority or body that makes the decision to acquit the defendant. Examples are 'jury', 'judge', 'court'.",
            "The role of the adjudicator is crucial as they are responsible for evaluating the evidence and determining the outcome of the case. Examples include 'jury' in a trial setting or 'judge' in a bench trial.",
            "In some cases, the adjudicator may be a higher court that overturns a previous conviction. Examples are 'high judge' or 'appellate court'.",
            "The adjudicator must be a recognized legal authority with the power to make binding decisions. Examples are 'Supreme Court', 'magistrate'.",
            "Unlike the 'prosecutor' who brings charges against the defendant, the adjudicator remains impartial and delivers the final verdict. Examples are 'tribunal', 'panel of judges'."
        ],
        "defendant": [
            "The defendant is the individual or entity that is being acquitted of the charges. Examples are 'sisters', 'I', 'he', 'you', 'Drew'.",
            "The defendant is the central figure in the acquittal event, as they are the ones who benefit from the not guilty verdict. Examples include 'the accused', 'the suspect'.",
            "In some cases, the defendant may be a group of people or an organization. Examples are 'the company', 'the team'.",
            "The defendant is distinct from the 'plaintiff' or 'prosecutor', who are the parties bringing the charges. Examples are 'the defendant', 'the accused party'.",
            "The defendant's identity is crucial for understanding the context of the acquittal. Examples are 'the individual', 'the person on trial'."
        ],
        "place": [
            "The place is the location where the acquittal event occurs. Examples are 'London', 'courtroom', 'Florida'.",
            "The place provides context for the legal jurisdiction and setting of the acquittal. Examples include 'city', 'state', 'country'.",
            "In some cases, the place may refer to the specific court or legal venue. Examples are 'Supreme Court', 'district court'.",
            "The place is important for understanding the legal framework and authority under which the acquittal is granted. Examples are 'jurisdiction', 'legal venue'.",
            "Unlike the 'origin' or 'destination' in an 'Extradite' event, the place in an 'Acquit' event is where the legal decision is made. Examples are 'court of appeals', 'trial court'."
