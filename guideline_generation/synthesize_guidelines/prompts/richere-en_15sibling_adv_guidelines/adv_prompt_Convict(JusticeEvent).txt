You are an expert in summarizing NLP event extraction guidelines. Your goal is to consolidate multiple detailed descriptions into a single concise, comprehensive "Advanced" guideline.

### Input Format ###
Event Type: Event Type Name
```json
{
  "Event Definition": [
    "Definition 1",
    "Definition 2",
    "Definition 3",
    "Definition 4",
    "Definition 5"
  ],
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    "Argument1": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    // Add additional arguments as necessary
  }
}
```

### Task ###
1. Consolidate the 5 definitions under "Event Definition" into a single definition:
   - Highlight all critical points and examples from the five definitions.
   - Ensure the description is concise, comprehensive, and clear, using formal language that non-experts can understand.

2. Do the same for each argument under "Arguments Definitions," producing a single advanced definition for each. 

### Output Format ###
```json
{
  "Event Definition": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the event type.",
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the mention argument.",
    "Argument1": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument1.",
    "Argument2": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument2."
    // Add additional arguments as applicable
  }
}
```

### Guidelines to Summarize ###
Event Type: prompt_Convict(JusticeEvent)
```json
{
    "Convict(JusticeEvent)": {
        "description": [
            "The event is triggered by the formal declaration of a defendant's guilt in a court of law. Example triggers include 'convicted', 'found guilty', and 'judgments'.",
            "The event is characterized by the legal determination that an individual has committed a crime, often resulting in a sentence. It involves judicial processes and outcomes.",
            "Unlike the 'Sentence' event, which focuses on the punishment given, the 'Convict' event centers on the determination of guilt. For instance, 'convicted' indicates a 'Convict' event, while 'sentenced' indicates a 'Sentence' event.",
            "Triggers such as 'acquitted' are indicative of the 'Acquit' event type, not the 'Convict' event type. 'Acquitted' means the defendant was found not guilty, whereas 'convicted' means the defendant was found guilty.",
            "The outcome of the 'Convict' event is the formal recognition of guilt, which may lead to subsequent events like sentencing or appeals. This differs from events like 'Pardon', where the focus is on forgiveness or nullification of the conviction."
        ]
    },
    "attributes": {
        "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
        "adjudicator": [
            "Examples are 'court', 'judge', or 'jury'. The adjudicator is the entity responsible for determining the guilt of the defendant.",
            "The adjudicator plays a crucial role in the legal process, as they are the authority that issues the conviction. For instance, 'court' in 'the court convicted him' is the adjudicator.",
            "In cases where the adjudicator is not explicitly mentioned, it is often implied by the context. For example, 'he was convicted' implies a judicial body made the decision.",
            "Unlike the 'prosecutor', who brings charges against the defendant, the adjudicator is neutral and makes the final decision on guilt. For example, 'the judge found him guilty' identifies the judge as the adjudicator.",
            "Edge cases include situations where multiple adjudicators are involved, such as 'the jury and judge convicted him'. Here, both the jury and judge are considered adjudicators."
        ],
        "defendant": [
            "Examples are 'mayor', 'two', 'i', 'Jacobs'. The defendant is the individual or entity being judged for a crime.",
            "The defendant is central to the 'Convict' event, as the event revolves around their guilt. For instance, 'the mayor was convicted' identifies the mayor as the defendant.",
            "In some cases, the defendant may be a group of people, such as 'the defendants were found guilty'. Here, 'defendants' refers to multiple individuals.",
            "Unlike the 'plaintiff', who brings a case against someone, the defendant is the one being accused and judged. For example, 'the authors sued him' identifies 'him' as the defendant.",
            "Edge cases include situations where the defendant's identity is not clear from the text. For example, 'convicted of fraud' implies there is a defendant, but their identity must be inferred from context."
        ],
        "place": [
            "Examples are 'Salonika', 'London', 'Massachusetts'. The place is the location where the conviction occurs.",
            "The place provides context for the legal jurisdiction and setting of the 'Convict' event. For instance, 'in Salonika, the court convicted him' identifies Salonika as the place.",
            "In some cases, the place may be implied rather than explicitly stated. For example, 'he was convicted' might imply a location based on previous context in the text.",
            "Unlike the 'origin' or 'destination' in events like 'Extradite', the place in a 'Convict' event is where the legal decision is made. For example, 'extradited from Sweden' involves movement, whereas 'convicted in Sweden' does not.",
            "Edge cases include situations where the place is a broader region rather than a specific city or court. For example, 'convicted in the United States' identifies the country as the place."
        ]
    }
