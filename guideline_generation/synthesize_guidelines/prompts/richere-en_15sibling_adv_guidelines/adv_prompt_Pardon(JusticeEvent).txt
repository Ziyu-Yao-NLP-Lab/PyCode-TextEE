You are an expert in summarizing NLP event extraction guidelines. Your goal is to consolidate multiple detailed descriptions into a single concise, comprehensive "Advanced" guideline.

### Input Format ###
Event Type: Event Type Name
```json
{
  "Event Definition": [
    "Definition 1",
    "Definition 2",
    "Definition 3",
    "Definition 4",
    "Definition 5"
  ],
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    "Argument1": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    // Add additional arguments as necessary
  }
}
```

### Task ###
1. Consolidate the 5 definitions under "Event Definition" into a single definition:
   - Highlight all critical points and examples from the five definitions.
   - Ensure the description is concise, comprehensive, and clear, using formal language that non-experts can understand.

2. Do the same for each argument under "Arguments Definitions," producing a single advanced definition for each. 

### Output Format ###
```json
{
  "Event Definition": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the event type.",
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the mention argument.",
    "Argument1": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument1.",
    "Argument2": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument2."
    // Add additional arguments as applicable
  }
}
```

### Guidelines to Summarize ###
Event Type: prompt_Pardon(JusticeEvent)
```json
{
    "Pardon(JusticeEvent)": {
        "description": [
            "The event is triggered by an official act of forgiving or excusing a person from a legal penalty or punishment. Example triggers include 'pardoned', 'pardons', and 'pardon'.",
            "The event is characterized by the involvement of an adjudicator who grants the pardon and a defendant who receives it. The place where the pardon is granted may also be specified.",
            "Unlike the 'ReleaseParole' event, which involves conditional freedom, the 'Pardon' event completely absolves the defendant of the legal consequences of their actions.",
            "Triggers such as 'commute' or 'release' are indicative of related events like 'Sentence' or 'ReleaseParole', not the 'Pardon' event type.",
            "The outcome of a 'Pardon' event is the removal of legal penalties for the defendant, distinguishing it from events like 'Convict' or 'Sentence', which impose legal penalties."
        ]
    },
    "attributes": {
        "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
        "adjudicator": [
            "Examples are the person or entity that grants the pardon, such as a governor, president, or state. In 'The state of Alabama posthumously pardoned three black men', 'Alabama' is the adjudicator.",
            "The adjudicator is crucial as they hold the authority to forgive the defendant's legal penalties. For instance, 'When Ford pardoned Nixon', 'Ford' is the adjudicator.",
            "In cases where the adjudicator is a collective entity, such as a government or court, the entity itself is annotated. For example, 'The government pardoned the activists', 'government' is the adjudicator.",
            "The adjudicator can also be an individual acting in an official capacity, like 'Governor Smith pardoned the prisoner', where 'Governor Smith' is the adjudicator.",
            "In some contexts, the adjudicator may be implied or not explicitly mentioned, but inferred from the context, such as 'He was later pardoned', where the adjudicator is implied."
        ],
        "defendant": [
            "Examples are the person or persons who receive the pardon, such as 'Nixon' in 'When Ford pardoned Nixon'.",
            "The defendant is the individual or group absolved of legal penalties. For instance, 'The state of Alabama posthumously pardoned three black men', 'three black men' are the defendants.",
            "In cases where the defendant is a collective group, such as 'The activists were pardoned', 'activists' is the defendant.",
            "The defendant can also be a specific individual, like 'He was later pardoned and freed', where 'He' is the defendant.",
            "In some contexts, the defendant may be referred to by a pronoun or implied, such as 'They were later pardoned', where 'they' is the defendant."
        ],
        "place": [
            "Examples are the location where the pardon is granted, such as 'Alabama' in 'The state of Alabama posthumously pardoned three black men'.",
            "The place is important as it provides the geographical context of the pardon event. For instance, 'The governor of California pardoned the prisoner', 'California' is the place.",
            "In cases where the place is a specific city or region, such as 'The mayor of New York pardoned the activist', 'New York' is the place.",
            "The place can also be a country or state, like 'The president of France pardoned the convict', where 'France' is the place.",
            "In some contexts, the place may be implied or not explicitly mentioned, but inferred from the context, such as 'He was later pardoned and freed', where the place is not specified."
        ]
    }
}
