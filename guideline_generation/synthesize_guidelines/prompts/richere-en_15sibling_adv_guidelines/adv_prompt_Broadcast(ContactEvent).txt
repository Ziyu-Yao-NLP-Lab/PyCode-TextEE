You are an expert in summarizing NLP event extraction guidelines. Your goal is to consolidate multiple detailed descriptions into a single concise, comprehensive "Advanced" guideline.

### Input Format ###
Event Type: Event Type Name
```json
{
  "Event Definition": [
    "Definition 1",
    "Definition 2",
    "Definition 3",
    "Definition 4",
    "Definition 5"
  ],
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    "Argument1": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    // Add additional arguments as necessary
  }
}
```

### Task ###
1. Consolidate the 5 definitions under "Event Definition" into a single definition:
   - Highlight all critical points and examples from the five definitions.
   - Ensure the description is concise, comprehensive, and clear, using formal language that non-experts can understand.

2. Do the same for each argument under "Arguments Definitions," producing a single advanced definition for each. 

### Output Format ###
```json
{
  "Event Definition": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the event type.",
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the mention argument.",
    "Argument1": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument1.",
    "Argument2": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument2."
    // Add additional arguments as applicable
  }
}
```

### Guidelines to Summarize ###
Event Type: prompt_Broadcast(ContactEvent)
```json
{
    "Broadcast(ContactEvent)": {
        "description": [
            "The event is triggered by a public or semi-public communication from an entity to an audience. Example triggers include 'addressing', 'call', 'report', 'declared', 'said', 'speak', and 'edicts'.",
            "The event is characterized by the dissemination of information, opinions, or directives from an entity to a group of people. It often involves a one-to-many communication format.",
            "Unlike Correspondence events, which involve direct communication between specific individuals or entities, Broadcast events are aimed at a broader audience and do not require a direct response.",
            "Triggers such as 'meet' or 'meeting' are indicative of Meet events, not Broadcast events, as they imply a two-way interaction rather than a one-way dissemination of information.",
            "The outcome of a Broadcast event is the spread of information or directives to a wider audience, whereas similar events like Correspondence or Meet focus on direct, often private, exchanges between parties."
        ]
    },
    "attributes": {
        "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
        "audience": [
            "Examples are 'group', 'students', 'king'. The audience is the group of people who receive the broadcasted message. It is important as it defines the target of the communication.",
            "The audience can be a specific group or a general public. For instance, 'students' in a university setting or 'the public' in a press release.",
            "In some cases, the audience may be implied rather than explicitly stated. For example, 'the press' implies the general public as the ultimate audience.",
            "Unlike the entity, which is the source of the message, the audience is the recipient. For example, in 'Gadhafi was addressing a group of students', 'Gadhafi' is the entity and 'students' are the audience.",
            "Edge cases include situations where the audience is not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from context, such as 'the press' implying the general public."
        ],
        "entity": [
            "Examples are 'Gadhafi', 'globalists', 'press', 'head', 'Palin', 'OBL', 'leaders'. The entity is the source or originator of the broadcasted message.",
            "The entity can be an individual, a group, or an organization. For instance, 'Gadhafi' as an individual, 'globalists' as a group, or 'the press' as an organization.",
            "The entity is responsible for the content of the broadcast. For example, 'the head of Diebold said his mission was to see that Bush was re-elected' identifies 'the head' as the entity.",
            "Unlike the audience, which receives the message, the entity is the one delivering it. For example, in 'Palin's having just accepted an invitation to speak', 'Palin' is the entity.",
            "Edge cases include situations where the entity is a collective or abstract group, such as 'globalists' or 'leaders', rather than a specific individual."
        ],
        "place": [
            "Examples are 'La Sapienza university', 'London', 'Goerkes Corner'. The place is the location where the broadcast event occurs or is relevant to.",
            "The place can be a physical location, such as a university or a city, where the broadcast is made or received.",
            "In some cases, the place may be implied or not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from context. For example, 'at a GUN SHOW' implies a specific location.",
            "Unlike the entity and audience, which are people or groups, the place is a geographical or physical setting. For example, 'La Sapienza university' in 'Gadhafi was addressing a group of students at La Sapienza university'.",
            "Edge cases include virtual or non-physical places, such as online platforms or broadcast studios, where the event takes place."
