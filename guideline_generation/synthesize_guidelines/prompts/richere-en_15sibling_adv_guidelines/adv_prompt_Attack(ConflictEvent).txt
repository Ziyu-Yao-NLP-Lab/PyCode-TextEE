You are an expert in summarizing NLP event extraction guidelines. Your goal is to consolidate multiple detailed descriptions into a single concise, comprehensive "Advanced" guideline.

### Input Format ###
Event Type: Event Type Name
```json
{
  "Event Definition": [
    "Definition 1",
    "Definition 2",
    "Definition 3",
    "Definition 4",
    "Definition 5"
  ],
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    "Argument1": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    // Add additional arguments as necessary
  }
}
```

### Task ###
1. Consolidate the 5 definitions under "Event Definition" into a single definition:
   - Highlight all critical points and examples from the five definitions.
   - Ensure the description is concise, comprehensive, and clear, using formal language that non-experts can understand.

2. Do the same for each argument under "Arguments Definitions," producing a single advanced definition for each. 

### Output Format ###
```json
{
  "Event Definition": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the event type.",
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the mention argument.",
    "Argument1": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument1.",
    "Argument2": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument2."
    // Add additional arguments as applicable
  }
}
```

### Guidelines to Summarize ###
Event Type: prompt_Attack(ConflictEvent)
```json
{
    "Attack(ConflictEvent)": {
        "description": [
            "The event is triggered by actions that involve physical harm or violence directed towards individuals or groups. Example triggers include 'burned', 'spraying', 'murder', 'fired', and 'killers'.",
            "The event is characterized by the presence of an attacker, a target, and often an instrument used to carry out the attack. The scope includes any act of violence or aggression, regardless of scale.",
            "Unlike other ConflictEvent types such as Demonstrate, which involves public displays of protest, the Attack event specifically involves direct physical harm or the threat of such harm.",
            "Triggers such as 'protesters' are indicative of Demonstrate events, not Attack events. Attack events are marked by terms that denote violence or physical aggression.",
            "The outcomes of Attack events typically include injury, death, or significant physical or psychological harm to the target, distinguishing them from other conflict-related events that may not result in such direct harm."
        ]
    },
    "attributes": {
        "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
        "attacker": [
            "Examples are 'they', 'terrorists', 'killers'. The attacker is the individual or group responsible for carrying out the attack. This argument identifies the source of the aggression.",
            "The attacker is crucial for understanding the context and motive behind the attack. It can be a person, group, or even an organization.",
            "In cases where the attacker is not explicitly mentioned, infer from context. For example, 'terrorists' in 'victims of terrorists' implies the attackers.",
            "The attacker can be identified through pronouns or specific names. For instance, 'they' in 'they burned her' refers to the attackers.",
            "Edge cases include situations where the attacker is a collective entity, such as 'the government' or 'the army'. These should be annotated as the attacker."
        ],
        "instrument": [
            "Examples are 'hot wires', 'CS gas', 'flash-bang devices'. The instrument is the tool or method used to carry out the attack.",
            "The instrument provides insight into the nature and severity of the attack. It can range from weapons to substances like gas.",
            "In some cases, the instrument may be implied rather than explicitly stated. For example, 'burned' implies the use of fire or a hot object.",
            "The instrument can be a physical object or a method. For instance, 'spraying' implies the use of a substance like gas or liquid.",
            "Edge cases include situations where the instrument is unconventional, such as 'psychological torture'. These should still be annotated as the instrument."
        ],
        "place": [
            "Examples are 'where', 'downtown Manhattan'. The place is the location where the attack occurs.",
            "The place helps contextualize the event, providing information on the setting and potential witnesses or bystanders.",
            "In some cases, the place may be a general area rather than a specific location. For example, 'in a basement' provides a general idea of the setting.",
            "The place can be identified through prepositions like 'in', 'at', or 'on'. For instance, 'in downtown Manhattan' specifies the location.",
            "Edge cases include virtual or non-physical locations, such as 'online' or 'in a chat room'. These should still be annotated as the place."
        ],
        "target": [
            "Examples are 'her', 'women', 'children', 'victims'. The target is the individual or group that is subjected to the attack.",
            "The target is essential for understanding the impact and consequences of the attack. It can be a person, group, or even an entity.",
            "In some cases, the target may be implied rather than explicitly stated. For example, 'victims' in 'victims of terrorists' implies the targets.",
            "The target can be identified through pronouns or specific names. For instance, 'her' in 'they burned her' refers to the target.",
            "Edge cases include situations where the target is a collective entity, such as 'the community' or 'the population'. These should be annotated as the target."
        ]
    }
}
