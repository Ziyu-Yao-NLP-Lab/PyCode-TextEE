You are an expert in summarizing NLP event extraction guidelines. Your goal is to consolidate multiple detailed descriptions into a single concise, comprehensive "Advanced" guideline.

### Input Format ###
Event Type: Event Type Name
```json
{
  "Event Definition": [
    "Definition 1",
    "Definition 2",
    "Definition 3",
    "Definition 4",
    "Definition 5"
  ],
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    "Argument1": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    // Add additional arguments as necessary
  }
}
```

### Task ###
1. Consolidate the 5 definitions under "Event Definition" into a single definition:
   - Highlight all critical points and examples from the five definitions.
   - Ensure the description is concise, comprehensive, and clear, using formal language that non-experts can understand.

2. Do the same for each argument under "Arguments Definitions," producing a single advanced definition for each. 

### Output Format ###
```json
{
  "Event Definition": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the event type.",
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the mention argument.",
    "Argument1": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument1.",
    "Argument2": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument2."
    // Add additional arguments as applicable
  }
}
```

### Guidelines to Summarize ###
Event Type: prompt_Contact(Event)
```json
{
    "Contact(Event)": {
        "description": [
            "The event is triggered by verbal or written communication between entities. Examples include 'stated', 'say', 'claimed', 'conversation', 'told', 'talking', and 'trapped'.",
            "The event is characterized by the exchange of information, opinions, or directives between one or more entities. It often involves direct or indirect speech acts.",
            "Unlike Transaction events, which involve the exchange of goods or services, Contact events focus on the exchange of information or communication. For example, 'owes' is indicative of a Transaction event, not a Contact event.",
            "Triggers such as 'stated', 'say', 'claimed', and 'conversation' indicate a Contact event, where the primary outcome is the dissemination or reception of information.",
            "The event can occur in various contexts, including formal statements, casual conversations, and directives. The key outcome is the communication itself, not the transfer of physical items or services."
        ]
    },
    "attributes": {
        "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
        "entity": [
            "Examples are individuals or groups involved in the communication. In 'Obama stated in ISLAMIC COUNTRIES', 'Obama' is the entity making the statement.",
            "The entity is the person or group who is either conveying or receiving the information. For instance, in 'Giulio Andreotti had to say something', 'Giulio Andreotti' is the entity.",
            "Entities can be multiple individuals or groups. In 'police told the man', both 'police' and 'man' are entities involved in the communication.",
            "The entity can be implied or explicitly mentioned. In 'He claimed', 'He' is the entity making the claim.",
            "Entities are crucial for identifying the participants in the communication. In 'talking to his friend', both 'he' and 'friend' are entities engaged in the conversation."
        ],
        "place": [
            "Examples are locations where the communication takes place. In 'Obama stated in ISLAMIC COUNTRIES', 'ISLAMIC COUNTRIES' is the place where the statement was made.",
            "The place provides context for the communication event. It can be a physical location or a more abstract setting. For example, 'in the showers' in 'several people were told in the showers' is the place.",
            "Places can be specific or general. In 'talking to his friend about it', the place is not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the context.",
            "The place helps to situate the event in a particular setting, which can be important for understanding the context of the communication. For instance, 'in a rational conversation' implies a setting conducive to discussion.",
            "In some cases, the place may not be explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the surrounding text. For example, 'in a 7-11' in 'bought Skittles from a 7-11' provides context for the subsequent communication."
        ]
    }
}
