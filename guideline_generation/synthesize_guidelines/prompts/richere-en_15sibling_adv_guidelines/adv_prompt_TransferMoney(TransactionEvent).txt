You are an expert in summarizing NLP event extraction guidelines. Your goal is to consolidate multiple detailed descriptions into a single concise, comprehensive "Advanced" guideline.

### Input Format ###
Event Type: Event Type Name
```json
{
  "Event Definition": [
    "Definition 1",
    "Definition 2",
    "Definition 3",
    "Definition 4",
    "Definition 5"
  ],
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    "Argument1": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    // Add additional arguments as necessary
  }
}
```

### Task ###
1. Consolidate the 5 definitions under "Event Definition" into a single definition:
   - Highlight all critical points and examples from the five definitions.
   - Ensure the description is concise, comprehensive, and clear, using formal language that non-experts can understand.

2. Do the same for each argument under "Arguments Definitions," producing a single advanced definition for each. 

### Output Format ###
```json
{
  "Event Definition": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the event type.",
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the mention argument.",
    "Argument1": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument1.",
    "Argument2": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument2."
    // Add additional arguments as applicable
  }
}
```

### Guidelines to Summarize ###
Event Type: prompt_TransferMoney(TransactionEvent)
```json
{
    "TransferMoney(TransactionEvent)": {
        "description": [
            "The event is triggered by the act of transferring money from one entity to another. Example triggers include 'spent', 'given', 'paid', 'gets', and 'loan'.",
            "The event is characterized by the movement of monetary value between parties, often involving a giver and a recipient. It can occur in various contexts such as aid, bonuses, payments, and loans.",
            "Unlike TransferOwnership, this event does not involve the transfer of physical or intellectual property but strictly pertains to monetary transactions.",
            "Triggers such as 'inheritance' are indicative of TransferOwnership, not this event type, as they involve the transfer of ownership of assets rather than money.",
            "The outcome of this event is the successful transfer of money, which can be identified by the presence of a giver, recipient, and sometimes a place where the transaction occurs."
        ]
    },
    "attributes": {
        "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
        "beneficiary": [
            "Examples are 'country' in the context of receiving aid or relief funds.",
            "The beneficiary is the entity that ultimately benefits from the transferred money, even if they are not the direct recipient.",
            "In cases where aid is provided, the beneficiary could be a country, organization, or community.",
            "Unlike the recipient, the beneficiary may not directly receive the money but gains from its use or distribution.",
            "Edge cases include situations where the beneficiary is an abstract entity, such as 'the economy' or 'the public'."
        ],
        "giver": [
            "Examples are 'E.U.' in the context of spending money on relief efforts.",
            "The giver is the entity that provides or transfers the money to another party.",
            "In financial transactions, the giver could be an individual, organization, government, or financial institution.",
            "Unlike the recipient, the giver is the source of the funds being transferred.",
            "Edge cases include situations where the giver is not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from context, such as 'his' in 'spent a trillion dollars on his stimulus'."
        ],
        "place": [
            "Examples are 'country' in the context of receiving aid or relief funds.",
            "The place is the location where the transfer of money occurs or where the beneficiary is situated.",
            "In international aid, the place could be a country or region receiving the funds.",
            "Unlike the giver or recipient, the place is a geographical location associated with the transaction.",
            "Edge cases include virtual or online transactions where the place may not be explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from context."
        ],
        "recipient": [
            "Examples are 'Stephen Hester' in the context of receiving a bonus.",
            "The recipient is the entity that directly receives the transferred money.",
            "In financial transactions, the recipient could be an individual, organization, or government entity.",
            "Unlike the beneficiary, the recipient is the direct receiver of the funds.",
            "Edge cases include situations where the recipient is not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from context, such as 'I' in 'I took out the loan'."
        ]
    }
}
