You are an expert in summarizing NLP event extraction guidelines. Your goal is to consolidate multiple detailed descriptions into a single concise, comprehensive "Advanced" guideline.

### Input Format ###
Event Type: Event Type Name
```json
{
  "Event Definition": [
    "Definition 1",
    "Definition 2",
    "Definition 3",
    "Definition 4",
    "Definition 5"
  ],
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    "Argument1": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    // Add additional arguments as necessary
  }
}
```

### Task ###
1. Consolidate the 5 definitions under "Event Definition" into a single definition:
   - Highlight all critical points and examples from the five definitions.
   - Ensure the description is concise, comprehensive, and clear, using formal language that non-experts can understand.

2. Do the same for each argument under "Arguments Definitions," producing a single advanced definition for each. 

### Output Format ###
```json
{
  "Event Definition": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the event type.",
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the mention argument.",
    "Argument1": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument1.",
    "Argument2": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument2."
    // Add additional arguments as applicable
  }
}
```

### Guidelines to Summarize ###
Event Type: prompt_PhoneWrite(ContactEvent)
```json
{
    "PhoneWrite(ContactEvent)": {
        "description": [
            "The event is triggered by any form of communication made via telephone or similar devices, such as a phone call, telephone conversation, or message. Example triggers include 'telephone', 'call', 'told', 'discussed', 'phone', 'chatted', 'contacted', and 'written'.",
            "The event is characterized by the exchange of information or messages between entities through a phone or similar communication device. It involves at least one entity initiating the contact and another entity receiving it.",
            "Unlike other ContactEvents, the PhoneWrite event specifically involves the use of a telephone or similar device as the medium of communication. For instance, 'discussed' in the context of a phone conversation is a trigger for PhoneWrite, but 'discussed' in a face-to-face meeting is not.",
            "Triggers such as 'call' and 'telephone' are indicative of the PhoneWrite event type, not other ContactEvents like face-to-face meetings or written correspondence without the use of a phone.",
            "The outcome of the PhoneWrite event is the successful transmission of information or messages between entities via a phone or similar device. This distinguishes it from other events where the medium of communication is different, such as emails or in-person conversations."
        ]
    },
    "attributes": {
        "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
        "entity": [
            "Examples are the individuals or groups involved in the phone communication. In the sentence 'The spokesman said by telephone from Agartala,' the 'spokesman' is the entity.",
            "The entity argument represents the participants in the phone communication. For instance, in 'Bush told Chretien by telephone,' both 'Bush' and 'Chretien' are entities.",
            "Entities are crucial as they identify who is involved in the communication. In 'He called Bush,' 'he' and 'Bush' are the entities.",
            "Entities can be individuals or groups. For example, in 'The leaders discussed by phone,' 'leaders' is the entity.",
            "In cases where pronouns are used, they should be resolved to their antecedents. For example, in 'She called him,' 'she' and 'him' should be identified as the entities involved in the communication."
        ],
        "place": [
            "Examples are the locations associated with the phone communication. In 'The spokesman said by telephone from Agartala,' 'Agartala' is the place.",
            "The place argument indicates where the communication is taking place or where the entities are located during the communication. For instance, in 'He called from his office,' 'office' is the place.",
            "Places are important as they provide context to the communication. In 'She called from New York,' 'New York' is the place.",
            "The place can be a specific location or a broader area. For example, in 'They discussed by phone from the White House,' 'White House' is the place.",
            "In some cases, the place might be implied or not explicitly mentioned. For example, in 'He called her,' if the context indicates a location, it should be annotated as the place."
        ]
    }
}
