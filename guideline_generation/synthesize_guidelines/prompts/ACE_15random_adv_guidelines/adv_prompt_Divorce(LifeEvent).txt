You are an expert in summarizing NLP event extraction guidelines. Your goal is to consolidate multiple detailed descriptions into a single concise, comprehensive "Advanced" guideline.

### Input Format ###
Event Type: Event Type Name
```json
{
  "Event Definition": [
    "Definition 1",
    "Definition 2",
    "Definition 3",
    "Definition 4",
    "Definition 5"
  ],
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    "Argument1": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    // Add additional arguments as necessary
  }
}
```

### Task ###
1. Consolidate the 5 definitions under "Event Definition" into a single definition:
   - Highlight all critical points and examples from the five definitions.
   - Ensure the description is concise, comprehensive, and clear, using formal language that non-experts can understand.

2. Do the same for each argument under "Arguments Definitions," producing a single advanced definition for each. 

### Output Format ###
```json
{
  "Event Definition": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the event type.",
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the mention argument.",
    "Argument1": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument1.",
    "Argument2": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument2."
    // Add additional arguments as applicable
  }
}
```

### Guidelines to Summarize ###
Event Type: prompt_Divorce(LifeEvent)
```json
{
    "Divorce(LifeEvent)": {
        "description": [
            "The event is triggered by the legal dissolution of a marriage, often indicated by terms such as 'divorce', 'filed for divorce', 'sued for divorce', or 'divorce settlement'.",
            "The event is triggered by actions or statements indicating the end of a marital relationship, such as 'filed for divorce', 'divorce case', or 'divorce settlement'.",
            "The event is triggered by legal proceedings or agreements that formally end a marriage, often involving court actions or settlements.",
            "The event is triggered by the formal process of ending a marriage, which can be indicated by legal filings, court rulings, or mutual agreements.",
            "The event is triggered by the termination of a marital relationship through legal means, often involving terms like 'divorce', 'divorce case', or 'divorce settlement'."
        ]
    },
    "attributes": {
        "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
        "person": [
            "Examples are 'Hunter', 'star', 'Michael Crichton', 'Anne-Marie', 'Rod Stewart', 'Rachel Hunter', 'Welches', 'his ex-wife'. These refer to the individuals involved in the divorce, either as the person filing for divorce or the spouse.",
            "The 'person' argument identifies the individuals whose marriage is being dissolved. This can include both parties in the divorce, such as 'Hunter' and 'star' or 'Anne-Marie' and 'Crichton'.",
            "Examples are 'Rachel Hunter', 'husband', 'Welches', 'his ex-wife'. This argument captures the names or references to the individuals directly involved in the divorce proceedings.",
            "The 'person' argument is crucial as it specifies the individuals whose marital relationship is ending. Examples include 'Hunter', 'star', 'Michael Crichton', and 'Anne-Marie'.",
            "Examples are 'Crichton', 'Anne-Marie', 'Rod Stewart', 'Rachel Hunter'. This argument highlights the people who are part of the divorce event, either as the petitioner or the respondent."
        ],
        "place": [
            "Examples are 'Los Angeles', 'court', 'Los Angeles Superior Court'. This argument specifies the location where the divorce proceedings are taking place or where the divorce is being filed.",
            "The 'place' argument identifies the geographical or institutional location related to the divorce event. Examples include 'Los Angeles' and 'court'.",
            "Examples are 'Los Angeles', 'court'. This argument captures the specific place where the divorce is being processed or discussed.",
            "The 'place' argument is important as it provides context about where the divorce proceedings are occurring. Examples include 'Los Angeles' and 'court'.",
            "Examples are 'Los Angeles', 'court'. This argument indicates the location associated with the divorce event, such as the city or the court where the divorce is filed."
        ]
    }
}
