You are an expert in summarizing NLP event extraction guidelines. Your goal is to consolidate multiple detailed descriptions into a single concise, comprehensive "Advanced" guideline.

### Input Format ###
Event Type: Event Type Name
```json
{
  "Event Definition": [
    "Definition 1",
    "Definition 2",
    "Definition 3",
    "Definition 4",
    "Definition 5"
  ],
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    "Argument1": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    // Add additional arguments as necessary
  }
}
```

### Task ###
1. Consolidate the 5 definitions under "Event Definition" into a single definition:
   - Highlight all critical points and examples from the five definitions.
   - Ensure the description is concise, comprehensive, and clear, using formal language that non-experts can understand.

2. Do the same for each argument under "Arguments Definitions," producing a single advanced definition for each. 

### Output Format ###
```json
{
  "Event Definition": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the event type.",
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the mention argument.",
    "Argument1": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument1.",
    "Argument2": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument2."
    // Add additional arguments as applicable
  }
}
```

### Guidelines to Summarize ###
Event Type: prompt_Injure(LifeEvent)
```json
{
    "Injure(LifeEvent)": {
        "description": [
            "The event is triggered by terms indicating physical harm or injury to individuals, such as 'wounded', 'injured', 'harm', or 'injuries'.",
            "The event is characterized by the infliction of physical damage or pain to one or more individuals, often resulting from violent actions or accidents.",
            "Unlike the 'Die' event type, the 'Injure' event does not result in the death of the victim but rather in non-fatal physical harm.",
            "Triggers such as 'killed' or 'dead' are indicative of the 'Die' event type, not the 'Injure' event type.",
            "The outcome of the 'Injure' event is the victim sustaining physical injuries, which may vary in severity but do not lead to death."
        ]
    },
    "attributes": {
        "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
        "agent": [
            "Examples are the person or entity causing the injury, such as 'bomber' in 'A suicide bomber detonated explosives'.",
            "The agent is responsible for the action that leads to the injury, such as 'attacker' or 'shooter'.",
            "In cases where the injury is accidental, the agent might be an inanimate object or natural force, like 'falling debris' or 'earthquake'.",
            "The agent can be an individual or a group, such as 'insurgents' or 'terrorists'.",
            "In some contexts, the agent might be implied rather than explicitly stated, such as 'the injured were taken to the hospital' where the cause of injury is understood from context."
        ],
        "instrument": [
            "Examples are the tools or means used to inflict the injury, such as 'explosives' in 'A suicide bomber detonated explosives'.",
            "The instrument can be a weapon or object, like 'gun', 'knife', or 'vehicle'.",
            "In some cases, the instrument might be a natural element, such as 'fire' or 'flood'.",
            "The instrument is crucial in understanding the nature of the injury, such as 'chemical' in 'chemical burns'.",
            "In some instances, the instrument might be part of the environment, like 'falling rocks' or 'collapsing building'."
        ],
        "place": [
            "Examples are the location where the injury occurred, such as 'mall' in 'A suicide bomber detonated explosives at the entrance to a crowded mall'.",
            "The place can be a specific building or area, like 'airport', 'school', or 'park'.",
            "In some cases, the place might be a broader geographical location, such as 'city' or 'country'.",
            "The place helps contextualize the event, providing information about where the injury took place, such as 'battlefield' or 'hospital'.",
            "In some contexts, the place might be implied or understood from the surrounding text, such as 'the injured were taken to the nearest hospital'."
        ],
        "victim": [
            "Examples are the individuals who sustained injuries, such as '20' in 'wounding 20 in the fifth such attack'.",
            "The victim can be a single person or multiple individuals, like 'people', 'children', or 'civilians'.",
            "In some cases, the victim might be described by their role or identity, such as 'soldiers', 'protesters', or 'bystanders'.",
            "The victim is the recipient of the injury, and their description can provide insight into the severity and impact of the event, such as 'severely injured' or 'minor injuries'.",
            "In some contexts, the victim might be implied or understood from the surrounding text, such as 'the injured were taken to the hospital'."
        ]
    }
}
