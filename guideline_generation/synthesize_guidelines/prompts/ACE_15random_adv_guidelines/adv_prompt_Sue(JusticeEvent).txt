You are an expert in summarizing NLP event extraction guidelines. Your goal is to consolidate multiple detailed descriptions into a single concise, comprehensive "Advanced" guideline.

### Input Format ###
Event Type: Event Type Name
```json
{
  "Event Definition": [
    "Definition 1",
    "Definition 2",
    "Definition 3",
    "Definition 4",
    "Definition 5"
  ],
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    "Argument1": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    // Add additional arguments as necessary
  }
}
```

### Task ###
1. Consolidate the 5 definitions under "Event Definition" into a single definition:
   - Highlight all critical points and examples from the five definitions.
   - Ensure the description is concise, comprehensive, and clear, using formal language that non-experts can understand.

2. Do the same for each argument under "Arguments Definitions," producing a single advanced definition for each. 

### Output Format ###
```json
{
  "Event Definition": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the event type.",
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the mention argument.",
    "Argument1": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument1.",
    "Argument2": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument2."
    // Add additional arguments as applicable
  }
}
```

### Guidelines to Summarize ###
Event Type: prompt_Sue(JusticeEvent)
```json
{
    "Sue(JusticeEvent)": {
        "description": [
            "The event is triggered by legal actions where one party (plaintiff) initiates a lawsuit against another party (defendant). Example triggers include 'lawsuit', 'sued', 'litigation', 'action', and 'claims'.",
            "The event is characterized by the formal process of bringing a legal case to court, typically involving a plaintiff and a defendant. It often includes legal terms and references to court proceedings.",
            "Unlike other JusticeEvents such as 'Acquit' or 'TrialHearing', the 'Sue' event specifically involves the initiation of legal action by a plaintiff against a defendant, rather than the outcome or process of a trial.",
            "Triggers such as 'acquitted' or 'hearing' are indicative of other JusticeEvents like 'Acquit' or 'TrialHearing', not the 'Sue' event type. The 'Sue' event focuses on the act of filing or pursuing a lawsuit.",
            "The outcome of the 'Sue' event is the initiation of legal proceedings, which may lead to a trial or settlement. This differs from events like 'Pardon' or 'Execute', which involve the resolution or enforcement of legal decisions."
        ]
    },
    "attributes": {
        "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
        "adjudicator": [
            "Examples are 'courts', 'judge', 'Supreme Court'. The adjudicator is the authority or body responsible for overseeing the legal proceedings and making judgments.",
            "The adjudicator plays a crucial role in the legal process, ensuring that the case is heard and a fair decision is made. This can include judges, courts, or other legal authorities.",
            "In some cases, the adjudicator may be a specific court or judge mentioned in the text. For example, 'the Supreme Court' or 'Judge Smith'.",
            "Unlike the 'defendant' or 'plaintiff', the adjudicator is not a party to the lawsuit but rather the entity that facilitates the legal process.",
            "Edge cases may include references to multiple adjudicators or courts, such as 'the courts' or 'various judges', indicating a broader legal oversight."
        ],
        "defendant": [
            "Examples are 'Iraq', 'Crichton', 'bankers'. The defendant is the party against whom the lawsuit is filed.",
            "The defendant is typically the individual, organization, or entity being accused or sued by the plaintiff. This can include companies, government bodies, or specific individuals.",
            "In legal texts, the defendant is often mentioned in the context of the accusations or claims made against them. For example, 'the lawsuit against Enron's bankers'.",
            "Unlike the 'plaintiff', the defendant is the party responding to the legal action and may be required to defend themselves in court.",
            "Edge cases may involve multiple defendants or collective entities, such as 'the pair' or 'the company's shareholders', indicating a group being sued."
        ],
        "place": [
            "Examples are 'Washington', 'United States', 'court'. The place refers to the location where the legal action is taking place or where the lawsuit is filed.",
            "The place is important as it provides context for the jurisdiction and legal framework under which the lawsuit is being pursued. This can include cities, countries, or specific courts.",
            "In some cases, the place may be a specific court or legal venue, such as 'the Washington court' or 'the United States Supreme Court'.",
            "Unlike other arguments, the place is not a party to the lawsuit but rather the setting or location of the legal proceedings.",
            "Edge cases may include references to multiple locations or jurisdictions, such as 'foreign courts' or 'various states', indicating a broader geographical context."
        ],
        "plaintiff": [
            "Examples are 'relatives', 'survivors', 'Enron Corp'. The plaintiff is the party initiating the lawsuit and making the legal claims.",
            "The plaintiff is typically the individual, organization, or entity that believes they have been wronged and is seeking legal redress. This can include victims, companies, or specific individuals.",
            "In legal texts, the plaintiff is often mentioned in the context of their grievances or the legal action they are pursuing. For example, 'the lawsuit filed by the victims' relatives'.",
            "Unlike the 'defendant', the plaintiff is the party bringing the legal action and seeking a resolution or compensation through the court.",
            "Edge cases may involve multiple plaintiffs or collective entities, such as 'the buyers and sellers' or 'the company's shareholders', indicating a group initiating the lawsuit."
