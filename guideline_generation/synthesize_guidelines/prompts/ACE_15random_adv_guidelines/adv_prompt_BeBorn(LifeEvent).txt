You are an expert in summarizing NLP event extraction guidelines. Your goal is to consolidate multiple detailed descriptions into a single concise, comprehensive "Advanced" guideline.

### Input Format ###
Event Type: Event Type Name
```json
{
  "Event Definition": [
    "Definition 1",
    "Definition 2",
    "Definition 3",
    "Definition 4",
    "Definition 5"
  ],
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    "Argument1": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    // Add additional arguments as necessary
  }
}
```

### Task ###
1. Consolidate the 5 definitions under "Event Definition" into a single definition:
   - Highlight all critical points and examples from the five definitions.
   - Ensure the description is concise, comprehensive, and clear, using formal language that non-experts can understand.

2. Do the same for each argument under "Arguments Definitions," producing a single advanced definition for each. 

### Output Format ###
```json
{
  "Event Definition": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the event type.",
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the mention argument.",
    "Argument1": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument1.",
    "Argument2": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument2."
    // Add additional arguments as applicable
  }
}
```

### Guidelines to Summarize ###
Event Type: prompt_BeBorn(LifeEvent)
```json
{
    "BeBorn(LifeEvent)": {
        "description": [
            "The event is triggered by the birth or emergence of a person. Example triggers include 'birth', 'born', 'cut out', 'removed', 'ripped', and 'having'.",
            "The event is characterized by the introduction of a new individual into the world. It typically involves a person being born and may include details about the place of birth.",
            "Unlike other LifeEvent types such as 'Die' or 'Marry', the BeBorn event specifically focuses on the beginning of life rather than its end or a significant life milestone.",
            "Triggers such as 'killed' or 'marry' are indicative of 'Attack' or 'Marry' events, not the BeBorn event type. The BeBorn event is solely concerned with the act of being born.",
            "The outcome of the BeBorn event is the existence of a new person. This event does not cover the circumstances leading to or following the birth, which may be covered by other event types."
        ]
    },
    "attributes": {
        "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
        "person": [
            "Examples are 'babies', 'one', 'other', 'infant', 'Hunter', 'girl', 'baby', 'that', 'child', 'girls', 'boys'. The 'person' argument identifies the individual(s) being born.",
            "The 'person' argument is crucial as it specifies who is being born. It can refer to a single individual or multiple individuals.",
            "In cases where the gender or identity of the person is not specified, terms like 'baby', 'infant', or 'child' may be used.",
            "Unlike other arguments, the 'person' argument must always refer to a human being. Non-human entities or objects are not applicable.",
            "Edge cases include ambiguous references such as 'that' or 'one', which still indicate a person being born but lack specific details."
        ],
        "place": [
            "Examples are 'home', 'New Zealand', 'nation'. The 'place' argument identifies the location where the birth occurs.",
            "The 'place' argument is important as it provides context about the geographical or physical location of the birth event.",
            "This argument can refer to a specific location (e.g., 'home', 'hospital') or a broader geographical area (e.g., 'New Zealand', 'nation').",
            "Unlike the 'person' argument, the 'place' argument is optional and may not always be present in the event description.",
            "Edge cases include vague or general locations such as 'area' or 'region', which still provide some context but lack specificity."
        ]
    }
}
```
