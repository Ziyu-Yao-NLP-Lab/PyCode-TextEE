You are an expert in summarizing NLP event extraction guidelines. Your goal is to consolidate multiple detailed descriptions into a single concise, comprehensive "Advanced" guideline.

### Input Format ###
Event Type: Event Type Name
```json
{
  "Event Definition": [
    "Definition 1",
    "Definition 2",
    "Definition 3",
    "Definition 4",
    "Definition 5"
  ],
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    "Argument1": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    // Add additional arguments as necessary
  }
}
```

### Task ###
1. Consolidate the 5 definitions under "Event Definition" into a single definition:
   - Highlight all critical points and examples from the five definitions.
   - Ensure the description is concise, comprehensive, and clear, using formal language that non-experts can understand.

2. Do the same for each argument under "Arguments Definitions," producing a single advanced definition for each. 

### Output Format ###
```json
{
  "Event Definition": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the event type.",
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the mention argument.",
    "Argument1": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument1.",
    "Argument2": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument2."
    // Add additional arguments as applicable
  }
}
```

### Guidelines to Summarize ###
Event Type: prompt_EndOrg(BusinessEvent)
```json
{
    "EndOrg(BusinessEvent)": {
        "description": [
            "The event is triggered by the termination or dissolution of an organization. Example triggers include 'is no more', 'dissolving', 'dismantling', 'crumbled', and 'collapsed'.",
            "The event is characterized by the end of an organization's existence or its functional operations. This can be due to various reasons such as political changes, internal decisions, or external pressures.",
            "Unlike events that signify changes within an organization (e.g., StartPosition), this event specifically marks the complete cessation of the organization's activities.",
            "Triggers such as 'hearing' or 'charges' are indicative of JusticeEvent types, not this event type, as they pertain to legal proceedings rather than the end of an organization.",
            "The outcomes of this event type involve the organization ceasing to exist or operate, which is different from events like 'Demonstrate' or 'Attack' that involve conflict but do not necessarily result in the end of an organization."
        ]
    },
    "attributes": {
        "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
        "org": [
            "Examples are 'rej geemg', 'party', 'empire', 'regime', 'Baath Party'. This argument identifies the organization that is ending.",
            "The 'org' argument is crucial as it specifies the entity that is ceasing to exist or function. It can be any type of organization, such as a political party, regime, or business entity.",
            "In the context of this event, 'org' refers to the specific organization whose termination is being described. For instance, 'Saddam Hussein's regime' in the phrase 'the regime is over'.",
            "Unlike arguments in other event types, 'org' here does not refer to individuals or groups involved in actions but to the entity that is ending.",
            "Edge cases include organizations that are part of larger entities. For example, 'Vivendi Universal's theme parks' in 'dismantling its entertainment empire' refers to a subset of the larger organization."
        ],
        "place": [
            "Examples are 'iraq'. This argument identifies the location where the organization is ending.",
            "The 'place' argument is important as it provides the geographical context for the event. It can be a country, city, or any specific location relevant to the organization's termination.",
            "In the context of this event, 'place' refers to the location associated with the organization's end. For instance, 'Iraq' in the phrase 'the focus in Iraq is turning from military action to rebuilding'.",
            "Unlike arguments in other event types, 'place' here does not refer to locations of actions or events but to the location relevant to the organization's end.",
            "Edge cases include situations where the location is implied rather than explicitly stated. For example, 'the local Baath Party leadership was crumbling' implies a specific location without directly naming it."
        ]
    }
}
```
