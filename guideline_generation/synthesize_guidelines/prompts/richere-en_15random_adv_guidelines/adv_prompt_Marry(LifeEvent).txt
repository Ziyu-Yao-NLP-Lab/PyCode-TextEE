You are an expert in summarizing NLP event extraction guidelines. Your goal is to consolidate multiple detailed descriptions into a single concise, comprehensive "Advanced" guideline.

### Input Format ###
Event Type: Event Type Name
```json
{
  "Event Definition": [
    "Definition 1",
    "Definition 2",
    "Definition 3",
    "Definition 4",
    "Definition 5"
  ],
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    "Argument1": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    // Add additional arguments as necessary
  }
}
```

### Task ###
1. Consolidate the 5 definitions under "Event Definition" into a single definition:
   - Highlight all critical points and examples from the five definitions.
   - Ensure the description is concise, comprehensive, and clear, using formal language that non-experts can understand.

2. Do the same for each argument under "Arguments Definitions," producing a single advanced definition for each. 

### Output Format ###
```json
{
  "Event Definition": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the event type.",
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the mention argument.",
    "Argument1": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument1.",
    "Argument2": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument2."
    // Add additional arguments as applicable
  }
}
```

### Guidelines to Summarize ###
Event Type: prompt_Marry(LifeEvent)
```json
{
    "Marry(LifeEvent)": {
        "description": [
            "The event is triggered by the act of entering into a marriage or civil union. Example triggers include 'marry', 'married', 'marriage', and 'remarried'.",
            "The event is characterized by the formal union of two individuals recognized by law, religion, or social norms. It involves a commitment to a long-term relationship.",
            "Unlike the Divorce event, which signifies the dissolution of a marriage, the Marry event signifies the beginning or continuation of a marital relationship.",
            "Triggers such as 'divorce' or 'separate' are indicative of the Divorce event type, not the Marry event type. The Marry event focuses on the union rather than the separation.",
            "The outcome of the Marry event is the establishment or reaffirmation of a marital relationship, which can be contrasted with events like 'Engage' that signify a promise to marry in the future but not the actual union."
        ]
    },
    "attributes": {
        "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
        "person": [
            "Examples are 'bride', 'groom', 'spouse', 'partner', 'individuals'. This argument identifies the people involved in the marriage.",
            "The role of the 'person' argument is to specify who is getting married. It is crucial for understanding the participants in the event.",
            "In cases where multiple people are mentioned, such as 'couples' or 'groups', each individual involved in the marriage should be identified.",
            "Edge cases include situations where the person is referred to indirectly, such as 'the couple' or 'the newlyweds'. These should still be annotated as 'person'.",
            "Domain knowledge: In some cultures, arranged marriages may involve terms like 'bride' and 'groom' even if the individuals are not explicitly named in the text."
        ],
        "place": [
            "Examples are 'church', 'city hall', 'beach', 'destination'. This argument identifies the location where the marriage takes place.",
            "The role of the 'place' argument is to provide context about where the marriage event occurs. It helps in understanding the setting of the event.",
            "In cases where the place is not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred, such as 'they got married in their hometown', the inferred location should be annotated.",
            "Edge cases include virtual or online marriages, where the 'place' might be a platform or service rather than a physical location.",
            "Domain knowledge: Some places are traditionally associated with marriages, such as 'Las Vegas' for quick weddings or 'church' for religious ceremonies."
        ]
    }
}
