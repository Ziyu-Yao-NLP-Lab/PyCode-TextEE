You are an expert in summarizing NLP event extraction guidelines. Your goal is to consolidate multiple detailed descriptions into a single concise, comprehensive "Advanced" guideline.

### Input Format ###
Event Type: Event Type Name
```json
{
  "Event Definition": [
    "Definition 1",
    "Definition 2",
    "Definition 3",
    "Definition 4",
    "Definition 5"
  ],
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    "Argument1": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    // Add additional arguments as necessary
  }
}
```

### Task ###
1. Consolidate the 5 definitions under "Event Definition" into a single definition:
   - Highlight all critical points and examples from the five definitions.
   - Ensure the description is concise, comprehensive, and clear, using formal language that non-experts can understand.

2. Do the same for each argument under "Arguments Definitions," producing a single advanced definition for each. 

### Output Format ###
```json
{
  "Event Definition": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the event type.",
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the mention argument.",
    "Argument1": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument1.",
    "Argument2": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument2."
    // Add additional arguments as applicable
  }
}
```

### Guidelines to Summarize ###
Event Type: prompt_Elect(PersonnelEvent)
```json
{
    "Elect(PersonnelEvent)": {
        "description": [
            "The event is triggered by the selection or appointment of a person to a position or office through a voting process or decision. Example triggers include 'elected', 're-elected', 'won', 'gained', 'stood', 'take', and 'unelected'.",
            "The event is characterized by the involvement of a person being chosen for a role, often through a formal or informal voting process. It typically involves an agent (voters or an organization) and may specify a place where the election occurs.",
            "Unlike other PersonnelEvents, the Elect event specifically involves the process of choosing or appointing someone to a position, rather than other forms of personnel changes such as hiring or firing.",
            "Triggers such as 'charged', 'extradite', 'addressing', and 'merge' are indicative of JusticeEvent, ContactEvent, and BusinessEvent types, not the Elect event type.",
            "The outcome of the Elect event is the selection of a person for a role, which differs from events like 'ChargeIndict' or 'Sentence' where the outcome involves legal consequences rather than a position appointment."
        ]
    },
    "attributes": {
        "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
        "agent": [
            "Examples are 'Catholics' in 'President Barack Obama won Iowa Catholics', where the agent represents the group or entity responsible for the election or voting process.",
            "The agent is crucial as it identifies who is responsible for electing the person. It can be a group of people, an organization, or a specific electorate.",
            "In the sentence 'Our government no longer listens to the people they were elected by', 'people' is the agent, indicating the voters.",
            "The agent can sometimes be implied or not explicitly mentioned, as in 'The head of Diebold said his mission was to see that Bush was re-elected', where the agent is implied to be the voters.",
            "Unlike the 'adjudicator' in JusticeEvents, the agent in Elect events is involved in the voting or selection process rather than making legal judgments."
        ],
        "person": [
            "Examples are 'Barack Obama' in 'President Barack Obama won Iowa Catholics', where the person is the individual being elected.",
            "The person is the central figure in the Elect event, as they are the one being chosen for a position or office.",
            "In 'The head of Diebold said his mission was to see that Bush was re-elected', 'Bush' is the person being re-elected.",
            "The person can be a candidate, incumbent, or any individual being considered for a role, as seen in 'If I was David Miliband I'd criticize him back, make a statement calling him an unelected fascist dictator'.",
            "Unlike the 'defendant' in JusticeEvents, the person in Elect events is not facing legal action but is being considered for a position."
        ],
        "place": [
            "Examples are 'Iowa' in 'President Barack Obama won Iowa Catholics', where the place indicates the location of the election or voting process.",
            "The place is important as it provides context for where the election is taking place, which can influence the event's significance.",
            "In 'Hey, you seem to know your stuff, a libertarian stood in an Ealing seat', 'Ealing' is the place where the election occurred.",
            "The place can be a city, state, or any geographical location relevant to the election, as seen in 'But obviously most importantly they have gained their first ever MP, Caroline Lucas in Brighton Pavilion'.",
            "Unlike the 'place' in events like 'Extradite' or 'TransferMoney', the place in Elect events is specifically related to the location of the electoral process."
