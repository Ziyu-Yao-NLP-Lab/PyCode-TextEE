You are an expert in summarizing NLP event extraction guidelines. Your goal is to consolidate multiple detailed descriptions into a single concise, comprehensive "Advanced" guideline.

### Input Format ###
Event Type: Event Type Name
```json
{
  "Event Definition": [
    "Definition 1",
    "Definition 2",
    "Definition 3",
    "Definition 4",
    "Definition 5"
  ],
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    "Argument1": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    // Add additional arguments as necessary
  }
}
```

### Task ###
1. Consolidate the 5 definitions under "Event Definition" into a single definition:
   - Highlight all critical points and examples from the five definitions.
   - Ensure the description is concise, comprehensive, and clear, using formal language that non-experts can understand.

2. Do the same for each argument under "Arguments Definitions," producing a single advanced definition for each. 

### Output Format ###
```json
{
  "Event Definition": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the event type.",
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the mention argument.",
    "Argument1": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument1.",
    "Argument2": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument2."
    // Add additional arguments as applicable
  }
}
```

### Guidelines to Summarize ###
Event Type: prompt_TrialHearing(JusticeEvent)
```json
{
    "TrialHearing(JusticeEvent)": {
        "description": [
            "The event is triggered by legal proceedings where a case is being heard or adjudicated, such as 'versus', 'v.', 'case', 'go to court', 'proven', and 'overruled'.",
            "The event is characterized by the involvement of an adjudicator, a defendant, and often a prosecutor, and it takes place in a legal setting such as a court.",
            "Unlike other JusticeEvents like 'Convict' or 'ArrestJail', this event focuses on the process of hearing and adjudicating a case rather than the outcome or enforcement of a legal decision.",
            "Triggers such as 'convicted' or 'arrested' are indicative of 'Convict' or 'ArrestJail' events, not this event type, which is more about the trial or hearing process itself.",
            "The outcome of a TrialHearing event is typically a legal decision or ruling, but the event itself is centered on the proceedings and arguments presented in court."
        ]
    },
    "attributes": {
        "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
        "adjudicator": [
            "Examples are 'judge', 'court', 'magistrate'. The adjudicator is the person or body responsible for overseeing the trial or hearing and making legal decisions.",
            "The adjudicator plays a crucial role in ensuring the trial is conducted fairly and according to the law. They may be referred to as 'judge', 'court', or 'magistrate'.",
            "In the context of a TrialHearing, the adjudicator is the authority figure who presides over the case, such as 'judge' or 'court'.",
            "Unlike the prosecutor or defendant, the adjudicator is neutral and responsible for maintaining order and legality in the proceedings.",
            "Edge cases include references to 'tribunal' or 'panel', which can also serve as adjudicators in certain legal contexts."
        ],
        "defendant": [
            "Examples are 'Miller', 'Aymette', 'he', 'NBP'. The defendant is the individual or entity against whom the case is brought.",
            "The defendant is a key participant in the trial, as they are the party being accused or sued. They may be referred to by name or pronoun.",
            "In a TrialHearing, the defendant is the person or organization that must respond to the charges or claims made against them.",
            "Unlike the prosecutor, who brings the case, the defendant is the one defending against the allegations.",
            "Edge cases include situations where the defendant is an organization or group, such as 'NBP' or 'State'."
        ],
        "place": [
            "Examples are 'Tennessee', 'Palermo', 'court'. The place is the location where the trial or hearing is taking place.",
            "The place provides context for the legal proceedings, indicating where the trial is being held. It can be a city, state, or specific court.",
            "In the context of a TrialHearing, the place is important for jurisdictional purposes and can affect the legal procedures followed.",
            "Unlike other events where place might refer to a broader location, in a TrialHearing, it specifically refers to the venue of the legal proceedings.",
            "Edge cases include references to specific courts or legal bodies, such as 'lower court' or 'higher court'."
        ],
        "prosecutor": [
            "Examples are 'United States', 'State', 'magistrate'. The prosecutor is the individual or entity bringing the case against the defendant.",
            "The prosecutor plays a critical role in presenting the case against the defendant, seeking to prove their guilt or liability.",
            "In a TrialHearing, the prosecutor is the party responsible for initiating the legal action and presenting evidence and arguments.",
            "Unlike the defendant, who is defending against the charges, the prosecutor is actively seeking a legal judgment against the defendant.",
            "Edge cases include situations where the prosecutor is a government entity or official, such as 'State' or 'magistrate'."
        ]
    }
