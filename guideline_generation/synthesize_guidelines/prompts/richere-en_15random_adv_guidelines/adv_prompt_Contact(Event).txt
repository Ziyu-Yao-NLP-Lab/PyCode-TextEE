You are an expert in summarizing NLP event extraction guidelines. Your goal is to consolidate multiple detailed descriptions into a single concise, comprehensive "Advanced" guideline.

### Input Format ###
Event Type: Event Type Name
```json
{
  "Event Definition": [
    "Definition 1",
    "Definition 2",
    "Definition 3",
    "Definition 4",
    "Definition 5"
  ],
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    "Argument1": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    // Add additional arguments as necessary
  }
}
```

### Task ###
1. Consolidate the 5 definitions under "Event Definition" into a single definition:
   - Highlight all critical points and examples from the five definitions.
   - Ensure the description is concise, comprehensive, and clear, using formal language that non-experts can understand.

2. Do the same for each argument under "Arguments Definitions," producing a single advanced definition for each. 

### Output Format ###
```json
{
  "Event Definition": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the event type.",
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the mention argument.",
    "Argument1": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument1.",
    "Argument2": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument2."
    // Add additional arguments as applicable
  }
}
```

### Guidelines to Summarize ###
Event Type: prompt_Contact(Event)
```json
{
    "Contact(Event)": {
        "description": [
            "The event is triggered by verbal or written communication between entities. Examples include 'stated', 'say', 'claimed', 'conversation', 'told', 'talking', 'trapped'.",
            "The event is characterized by the exchange of information, opinions, or directives between one or more entities. It often involves direct or indirect speech.",
            "Unlike events such as 'Appeal' or 'Extradite', which involve legal actions, the 'Contact' event focuses on the act of communication itself, regardless of the content or legal implications.",
            "Triggers such as 'appealed' or 'extradite' are indicative of legal proceedings and are not considered 'Contact' events. Instead, 'Contact' events are marked by communication verbs like 'stated' or 'talking'.",
            "The outcome of a 'Contact' event is the transmission of information or directives, unlike 'Attack' or 'Convict' events, which result in physical harm or legal judgments."
        ]
    },
    "attributes": {
        "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
        "entity": [
            "Examples are individuals or groups involved in the communication. In 'Obama stated in ISLAMIC COUNTRIES', 'Obama' is the entity.",
            "The entity is the person or group who initiates or participates in the communication. For instance, in 'Giulio Andreotti had to say something', 'Giulio Andreotti' is the entity.",
            "Entities can be multiple, as seen in 'police told the man', where both 'police' and 'man' are entities.",
            "The entity is crucial as it identifies the source or recipient of the communication. In 'He claimed', 'He' is the entity.",
            "In cases where the communication involves multiple parties, each participant is considered an entity. For example, 'he was talking to his friend' includes 'he' and 'friend' as entities."
        ],
        "place": [
            "Examples are locations where the communication takes place. In 'Obama stated in ISLAMIC COUNTRIES', 'ISLAMIC COUNTRIES' is the place.",
            "The place provides context to the communication event, indicating where it occurred. For instance, 'at La Sapienza university' in 'Gadhafi was addressing' is the place.",
            "Places can be specific or general, such as 'COUNTRIES' or 'Goerkes Corner'.",
            "The place is important for understanding the setting of the communication. In 'meeting up with someone there', 'there' refers to 'Goerkes Corner'.",
            "In some cases, the place may not be explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the context. For example, 'in a small city' in 'He took two small papers' implies a place."
        ]
    }
}
```
