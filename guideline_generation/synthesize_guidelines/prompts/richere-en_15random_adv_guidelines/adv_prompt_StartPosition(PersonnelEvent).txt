You are an expert in summarizing NLP event extraction guidelines. Your goal is to consolidate multiple detailed descriptions into a single concise, comprehensive "Advanced" guideline.

### Input Format ###
Event Type: Event Type Name
```json
{
  "Event Definition": [
    "Definition 1",
    "Definition 2",
    "Definition 3",
    "Definition 4",
    "Definition 5"
  ],
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    "Argument1": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    // Add additional arguments as necessary
  }
}
```

### Task ###
1. Consolidate the 5 definitions under "Event Definition" into a single definition:
   - Highlight all critical points and examples from the five definitions.
   - Ensure the description is concise, comprehensive, and clear, using formal language that non-experts can understand.

2. Do the same for each argument under "Arguments Definitions," producing a single advanced definition for each. 

### Output Format ###
```json
{
  "Event Definition": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the event type.",
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the mention argument.",
    "Argument1": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument1.",
    "Argument2": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument2."
    // Add additional arguments as applicable
  }
}
```

### Guidelines to Summarize ###
Event Type: prompt_StartPosition(PersonnelEvent)
```json
{
    "StartPosition(PersonnelEvent)": {
        "description": [
            "The event is triggered by a person beginning a new role or position, often indicated by verbs such as 'start', 'begin', 'take', 'promoted', 'appointed', 'back at work', and 'get'.",
            "The event is characterized by a transition into a new job, role, or position, typically involving a person and sometimes specifying the entity or place associated with the new role.",
            "Unlike the EndPosition event, which marks the conclusion of a role, the StartPosition event signifies the commencement of a new role or position.",
            "Triggers such as 'resigned', 'retired', or 'left' are indicative of the EndPosition event, not the StartPosition event.",
            "The outcome of this event is the person assuming a new role or position, which can be contrasted with related events like Nominate, where the person is proposed for a role but has not yet assumed it."
        ]
    },
    "attributes": {
        "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
        "entity": [
            "Examples are 'papers' in 'He took two small papers with declining circulation in a small city in South Australia and built a media empire.'",
            "The entity argument refers to the organization, company, or specific role that the person is starting.",
            "In the context of 'promoted Captains', the entity would be the rank or position of 'Captains'.",
            "For 'appointed as his Attorney General', the entity is 'Attorney General'.",
            "Unlike the person argument, which identifies the individual, the entity specifies the role or position being assumed."
        ],
        "person": [
            "Examples are 'He' in 'He took two small papers with declining circulation in a small city in South Australia and built a media empire.'",
            "The person argument identifies the individual who is starting the new role or position.",
            "In 'promoted Captains', the person argument would be 'few', referring to the individuals promoted.",
            "For 'appointed a man who couldn't figure out TurboTax as our Treasury Secretary', the person is 'man'.",
            "Unlike the entity argument, which specifies the role, the person argument focuses on the individual assuming the role."
        ],
        "place": [
            "Examples are 'city' in 'He took two small papers with declining circulation in a small city in South Australia and built a media empire.'",
            "The place argument indicates the location where the new role or position is being assumed.",
            "In 'back at work', if specified, the place could be the workplace or city where the person is returning to work.",
            "For 'appointed as his Attorney General', if the location were specified, it would be included as the place argument.",
            "Unlike the entity and person arguments, the place argument provides geographical context to the event."
        ]
    }
}
```
