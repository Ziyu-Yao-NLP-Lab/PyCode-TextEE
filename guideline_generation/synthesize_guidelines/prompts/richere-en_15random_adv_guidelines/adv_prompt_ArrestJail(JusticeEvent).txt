You are an expert in summarizing NLP event extraction guidelines. Your goal is to consolidate multiple detailed descriptions into a single concise, comprehensive "Advanced" guideline.

### Input Format ###
Event Type: Event Type Name
```json
{
  "Event Definition": [
    "Definition 1",
    "Definition 2",
    "Definition 3",
    "Definition 4",
    "Definition 5"
  ],
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    "Argument1": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    // Add additional arguments as necessary
  }
}
```

### Task ###
1. Consolidate the 5 definitions under "Event Definition" into a single definition:
   - Highlight all critical points and examples from the five definitions.
   - Ensure the description is concise, comprehensive, and clear, using formal language that non-experts can understand.

2. Do the same for each argument under "Arguments Definitions," producing a single advanced definition for each. 

### Output Format ###
```json
{
  "Event Definition": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the event type.",
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the mention argument.",
    "Argument1": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument1.",
    "Argument2": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument2."
    // Add additional arguments as applicable
  }
}
```

### Guidelines to Summarize ###
Event Type: prompt_ArrestJail(JusticeEvent)
```json
{
    "ArrestJail(JusticeEvent)": {
        "description": [
            "The event is triggered by actions that result in the detention or imprisonment of an individual. Example triggers include 'arrested', 'busted', 'locked away', and 'jail'.",
            "The event is characterized by the involvement of law enforcement or other authorities detaining a person. It typically involves a person being taken into custody or confined to a specific place.",
            "Unlike the 'TrialHearing' event, which involves legal proceedings, the 'ArrestJail' event focuses on the act of detaining or imprisoning an individual. For example, 'arrested' indicates 'ArrestJail', not 'TrialHearing'.",
            "Triggers such as 'arrested' and 'busted' are indicative of 'ArrestJail', not events like 'Execute' or 'Extradite', which involve different legal outcomes or processes.",
            "The event outcomes include the person being held in custody or confined to a jail or prison. This differs from 'Acquit', where the person is found not guilty and released, or 'Appeal', which involves challenging a legal decision."
        ]
    },
    "attributes": {
        "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
        "agent": [
            "Examples are law enforcement officers or authorities responsible for the arrest or imprisonment. For instance, 'they' in 'they have arrested over 300' refers to the police or authorities.",
            "The agent is crucial as it identifies who is carrying out the arrest or imprisonment. In 'the mounties busted the cell', 'mounties' is the agent.",
            "In some cases, the agent may be implied rather than explicitly stated. For example, 'busted' in 'the sheriff just got busted' implies law enforcement as the agent.",
            "The agent can be a specific organization or group, such as 'the police', 'FBI', or 'mounties'. In 'the mounties busted the cell', 'mounties' is the agent.",
            "Unlike 'Execute' where the agent might be a court or executioner, in 'ArrestJail', the agent is typically law enforcement or similar authorities."
        ],
        "person": [
            "Examples are individuals or groups who are being arrested or jailed. For instance, '300' in 'they have arrested over 300' refers to the people arrested.",
            "The person is the central figure in the event, as they are the ones being detained or imprisoned. In 'arrest Koresh and others', 'Koresh' and 'others' are the persons.",
            "In some cases, the person may be a group or collective entity, such as 'a bunch of hacks' or 'the terrorist cell'.",
            "The person can be identified by their role or identity, such as 'sheriff' in 'the sheriff just got busted'.",
            "Unlike 'Execute' where the person might be sentenced to death, in 'ArrestJail', the person is detained or imprisoned."
        ],
        "place": [
            "Examples are locations where the arrest or imprisonment takes place. For instance, 'Rapid City' in 'arrested over 300 in Rapid City' refers to the place of arrest.",
            "The place is important as it provides context for where the event occurs. In 'locked away in prison', 'prison' is the place.",
            "In some cases, the place may be a broader location, such as 'county' in 'the sheriff just got busted in the county'.",
            "The place can be a specific facility or general area, such as 'jail', 'prison', or 'city'. In 'arrested in Rapid City', 'Rapid City' is the place.",
            "Unlike 'Extradite' where the place might involve origin and destination, in 'ArrestJail', the place is where the arrest or imprisonment happens."
