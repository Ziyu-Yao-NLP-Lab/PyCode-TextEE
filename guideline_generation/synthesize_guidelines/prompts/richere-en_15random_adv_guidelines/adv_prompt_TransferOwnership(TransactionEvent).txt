You are an expert in summarizing NLP event extraction guidelines. Your goal is to consolidate multiple detailed descriptions into a single concise, comprehensive "Advanced" guideline.

### Input Format ###
Event Type: Event Type Name
```json
{
  "Event Definition": [
    "Definition 1",
    "Definition 2",
    "Definition 3",
    "Definition 4",
    "Definition 5"
  ],
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    "Argument1": [
      "Definition 1",
      "Definition 2",
      "Definition 3",
      "Definition 4",
      "Definition 5"
    ],
    // Add additional arguments as necessary
  }
}
```

### Task ###
1. Consolidate the 5 definitions under "Event Definition" into a single definition:
   - Highlight all critical points and examples from the five definitions.
   - Ensure the description is concise, comprehensive, and clear, using formal language that non-experts can understand.

2. Do the same for each argument under "Arguments Definitions," producing a single advanced definition for each. 

### Output Format ###
```json
{
  "Event Definition": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the event type.",
  "Arguments Definitions": {
    "mention": "Consolidated advanced guideline for the mention argument.",
    "Argument1": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument1.",
    "Argument2": "Consolidated advanced guideline for Argument2."
    // Add additional arguments as applicable
  }
}
```

### Guidelines to Summarize ###
Event Type: prompt_TransferOwnership(TransactionEvent)
```json
{
    "TransferOwnership(TransactionEvent)": {
        "description": [
            "The event is triggered by the transfer of ownership of an item or property from one entity to another. Example triggers include 'inheritance', 'buying', 'ordered', 'hijack', and 'get'.",
            "The event is characterized by the change in possession or control of a tangible or intangible asset. It involves at least two parties: the giver and the recipient.",
            "Unlike TransferMoney, this event does not involve the transfer of monetary funds but rather the transfer of ownership of physical or intellectual property.",
            "Triggers such as 'inheritance' and 'buying' are indicative of TransferOwnership, not TransferMoney, which would involve terms like 'paid' or 'transferred funds'.",
            "The outcome of this event is the recipient gaining ownership or control over the thing, while the giver relinquishes it. This is distinct from events like Extradite, which involve the transfer of a person rather than ownership of an item."
        ]
    },
    "attributes": {
        "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
        "beneficiary": [
            "Examples are 'THEIR' in 'STOP BUYING THINGS FOR THEIR HOME!'. The beneficiary is the entity that benefits from the transfer of ownership.",
            "The beneficiary is important as it identifies who gains from the transaction, even if they are not the direct recipient.",
            "In some cases, the beneficiary may be a group or organization rather than an individual.",
            "The beneficiary can be implicit in the context, such as 'they' in 'they didn't get it, but they asked for it.'",
            "Unlike the recipient, the beneficiary may not directly receive the item but still gains from the transaction."
        ],
        "giver": [
            "Examples are 'father' in 'His father having died, he returned to Australia in 1954 to take over his inheritance'. The giver is the entity that relinquishes ownership.",
            "The giver is crucial as it indicates the source of the item or property being transferred.",
            "In some contexts, the giver may be deceased or otherwise unable to participate actively in the transaction.",
            "The giver can be an individual, organization, or entity, such as 'E.U.' in 'Washington had delivered 100,000 metric tons of food and the E.U. had spent 200 million euros on relief.'",
            "Unlike the recipient, the giver is the one who loses ownership or control over the item."
        ],
        "place": [
            "Examples are 'Adelaide' in 'the Sunday Mail and The News, both of Adelaide'. The place is the location where the transfer occurs or is relevant to the transaction.",
            "The place is important as it provides context and situates the event geographically.",
            "In some cases, the place may be a virtual or non-physical location, such as an online marketplace.",
            "The place can also indicate where the item originated or where it is being transferred to, such as '7-11' in 'a young teen who bought Skittles from a 7-11'.",
            "Unlike the giver or recipient, the place is a location and not an entity involved in the transaction."
        ],
        "recipient": [
            "Examples are 'his' in 'he returned to Australia in 1954 to take over his inheritance'. The recipient is the entity that receives ownership of the item.",
            "The recipient is key as it identifies who gains control or possession of the item or property.",
            "In some contexts, the recipient may be a group or organization rather than an individual.",
            "The recipient can be implicit in the context, such as 'they' in 'they didn't get it, but they asked for it.'",
            "Unlike the beneficiary, the recipient directly receives the item or property being transferred."
        ],
        "thing": [
            "Examples are 'Sunday Mail' and 'News' in 'he returned to Australia in 1954 to take over his inheritance, the Sunday Mail and The News'. The thing is the item or property being transferred.",
            "The thing is crucial as it is the object of the transaction and what is being transferred from the giver to the recipient.",
            "In some cases, the thing may be intangible, such as intellectual property or rights.",
            "The thing can be a single item or multiple items, such as 'planes' in 'The Jihadists have little hope of being able to hijack any more planes so easily.'",
            "Unlike the giver or recipient, the thing is the object being transferred and not an entity involved in the transaction."
        ]
    }
