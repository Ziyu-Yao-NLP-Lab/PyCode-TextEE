            "The Cognitive_Inspection_SensoryObserve event involves an entity using sensory perception to examine or inspect another entity or object. The event can be triggered by verbs such as 'investigate', 'search', 'examine', 'observe', 'inspect', 'watch', 'discover', 'collect evidence', and 'recover'. This event typically involves an observer who performs the inspection, an observed entity that is being inspected, and optionally, an instrument used for the inspection and the place where the inspection occurs.",
