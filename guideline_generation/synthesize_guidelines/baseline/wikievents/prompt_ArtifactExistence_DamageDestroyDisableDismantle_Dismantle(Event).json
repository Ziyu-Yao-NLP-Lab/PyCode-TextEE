            "The event type 'ArtifactExistence_DamageDestroyDisableDismantle_Dismantle' refers to the action of taking apart or disassembling an artifact into its individual components. The event can be triggered by verbs such as 'dismantle', 'disassemble', 'take apart', 'deconstruct', and 'break down'. This event typically involves a dismantler (the entity performing the action), an artifact (the object being dismantled), and may include components (the parts resulting from the dismantling), an instrument (the tool used for dismantling), and a place (the location where the dismantling occurs).",
            "The 'ArtifactExistence_DamageDestroyDisableDismantle_Dismantle' event involves the process of breaking down an artifact into its constituent parts. The event can be triggered by words like 'dismantle', 'disassemble', 'take apart', 'deconstruct', and 'break down'. Key participants in this event include the dismantler, the artifact, and potentially the components, instrument, and place associated with the dismantling process.",
