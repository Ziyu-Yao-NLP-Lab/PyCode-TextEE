            "The Transport event, a subtype of MovementEvent, involves the movement of entities (people, objects, etc.) from one location to another. The event can be triggered by verbs or phrases indicating movement such as 'transport', 'drive', 'fly', 'bring', 'head', 'parachute', etc. The event can be triggered by both explicit and implicit mentions of movement. For example, 'The troops were flown to the base' explicitly mentions the movement, while 'The troops arrived at the base' implies it.",
            "The Transport event, under the MovementEvent category, captures scenarios where entities are moved between locations. This event can be triggered by words like 'transport', 'drive', 'fly', 'bring', 'head', 'parachute', etc. The event can be triggered by both direct and indirect references to movement. For instance, 'She drove to the city' directly mentions the movement, while 'She is now in the city' implies it.",
            "The Transport event, classified under MovementEvent, refers to the relocation of entities from one place to another. Triggers for this event include verbs and phrases such as 'transport', 'drive', 'fly', 'bring', 'head', 'parachute', etc. The event can be triggered by both clear and inferred mentions of movement. For example, 'The goods were shipped to the warehouse' clearly indicates movement, while 'The goods are now in the warehouse' suggests it.",
            "The Transport event, a child of MovementEvent, involves the transfer of entities between locations. This event can be triggered by terms like 'transport', 'drive', 'fly', 'bring', 'head', 'parachute', etc. The event can be triggered by both explicit and implicit mentions of movement. For example, 'The children were taken to school' explicitly mentions the movement, while 'The children are at school' implies it.",
            "The Transport event, under the MovementEvent superclass, captures the movement of entities from one location to another. Triggers for this event include words and phrases such as 'transport', 'drive', 'fly', 'bring', 'head', 'parachute', etc. The event can be triggered by both direct and indirect references to movement. For instance, 'The supplies were delivered to the site' directly mentions the movement, while 'The supplies are now at the site' implies it."
