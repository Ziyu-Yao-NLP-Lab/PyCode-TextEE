            "The StartOrg event, a subtype of BusinessEvent, refers to the initiation or establishment of a new organization or entity. This can include the founding, launching, or creation of a business, group, or other formal entity.",
            "StartOrg events are triggered by actions that signify the beginning or formation of an organization. This includes verbs like 'found', 'launch', 'create', 'build', and 'establish'.",
            "The event can be triggered by phrases indicating the start of an organization, such as 'founding a company', 'launching a new group', or 'creating a new entity'.",
            "StartOrg events capture the moment an organization comes into existence, often marked by formal announcements, public declarations, or significant milestones.",
            "This event type is concerned with the initial formation of an organization, distinguishing it from other business events that may involve ongoing operations or changes within an existing entity."

            "The agent is typically the subject or actor in the sentence who performs the action of starting the organization.",
            "In cases where multiple agents are involved, all relevant entities should be annotated, such as 'Twentieth Century Fox' and 'he' in 'he helped launch the Fox Television network'.",

            "The place should be annotated even if it is part of a larger phrase, ensuring that the full location context is captured."
