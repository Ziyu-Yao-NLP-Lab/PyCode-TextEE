            "The Injure event, a subclass of LifeEvent, refers to any incident where an individual or group suffers physical harm or injury. The event can be triggered by words such as 'wounding', 'injured', 'injuries', 'harm', etc. The event can occur in various contexts, including accidents, attacks, or natural disasters. Edge cases include situations where the harm is implied rather than explicitly stated, or where the injury is psychological rather than physical.",
            "Injure events are instances where physical harm is inflicted on individuals or groups. This event type is a subset of LifeEvent and can be triggered by terms like 'wounded', 'injured', 'harm', and similar expressions. The event can be caused by various agents and instruments, and can occur in diverse locations. Edge cases might involve indirect references to injuries or metaphorical uses of injury-related terms.",
            "An Injure event, under the LifeEvent category, involves scenarios where people are physically harmed. Triggers for this event include words such as 'wounding', 'injured', 'injuries', and 'harm'. These events can happen due to accidents, violence, or other harmful actions. Edge cases include non-physical injuries or situations where the injury is not directly mentioned but implied.",
            "The Injure event, classified under LifeEvent, denotes occurrences where individuals sustain physical injuries. Typical triggers include 'wounding', 'injured', 'injuries', and 'harm'. These events can result from various causes like accidents, attacks, or disasters. Edge cases may involve ambiguous references to injuries or contexts where the injury is not explicitly described.",
            "Injure events, a type of LifeEvent, are characterized by incidents where individuals are physically harmed. Common triggers are 'wounding', 'injured', 'injuries', and 'harm'. These events can arise from different situations such as accidents, violent acts, or natural calamities. Edge cases include indirect mentions of injuries or metaphorical uses of injury-related terms."
