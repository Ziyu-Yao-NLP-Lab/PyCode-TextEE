            "The event is triggered by legal proceedings where a case is being heard or adjudicated, such as 'versus', 'v.', 'case', 'go to court', 'proven', and 'overruled'.",
            "The event is characterized by the involvement of an adjudicator, a defendant, and often a prosecutor, and it takes place in a legal setting such as a court.",
            "Unlike other JusticeEvents like 'Convict' or 'ArrestJail', this event focuses on the process of hearing and adjudicating a case rather than the outcome or enforcement of a legal decision.",
            "Triggers such as 'convicted' or 'arrested' are indicative of 'Convict' or 'ArrestJail' events, not this event type, which is more about the trial or hearing process itself.",
            "The outcome of a TrialHearing event is typically a legal decision or ruling, but the event itself is centered on the proceedings and arguments presented in court."
