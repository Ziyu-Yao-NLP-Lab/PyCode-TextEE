            "The event is triggered by the combination of two or more organizations into a single entity. Typical triggers include 'merge', 'merged', 'merger', and 'mergers'.",
            "The event reflects a business strategy where organizations consolidate to leverage resources, expand market reach, reduce competition, or enhance capabilities.",
            "The event involves formal legal and financial processes to unify separate business entities under a common management and operational structure.",
            "Unlike related BusinessEvents such as 'StartOrg' or 'TransferOwnership', 'MergeOrg' specifically denotes the integration of existing organizations rather than the creation of a new entity or the transfer of assets.",
            "The event has significant implications for stakeholders including employees, shareholders, and customers, as it often results in organizational restructuring, changes in service delivery, and shifts in market dynamics."

            "Examples are names of the organizations involved in the merger. These can be companies, educational institutions, or airlines, such as 'ABN Amro', 'US Airways', 'Southwest High'.",
            "The 'org' argument identifies all parties involved in the merger, capturing both the acquiring and the acquired entities when mentioned.",
            "This argument can include multiple organizations within a single event instance, as mergers often involve several entities that are listed in the event description.",
            "In cases where general terms like 'airlines' or 'schools' are used, the 'org' argument captures these broader categories when specific names are not provided.",
            "Annotations should clearly differentiate the entities as separate arguments when they maintain distinct identities in the text, even as they merge into a single organization."
