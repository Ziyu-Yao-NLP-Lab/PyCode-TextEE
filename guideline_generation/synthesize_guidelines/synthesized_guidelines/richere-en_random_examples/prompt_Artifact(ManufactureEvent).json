            "The event is triggered by actions related to the creation or production of an artifact. Example triggers include 'building', 'makes', 'produce', and 'built'.",
            "The event is characterized by the involvement of an agent who is responsible for the creation, a place where the creation occurs, and the artifact that is being created. For instance, 'Diebold no longer makes voting machines' involves 'Diebold' as the agent and 'voting machines' as the artifact.",
            "Unlike TransportArtifact events, which involve the movement of artifacts from one place to another, Artifact events focus solely on the creation or production of artifacts. For example, 'building this Muslim complex' is an Artifact event, whereas 'bringing guns to school' is a TransportArtifact event.",
            "Triggers such as 'building' and 'produce' are indicative of Artifact events, not events like TransportArtifact or Correspondence. For instance, 'building schools' is an Artifact event, while 'meeting with Foreign Secretary' is a Correspondence event.",
            "The outcome of an Artifact event is the existence of a new or modified artifact, unlike events such as EndOrg, which result in the termination of an organization. For example, 'The district built a planetarium' results in a new planetarium, whereas 'the district closed almost half the schools' results in the termination of schools."

            "The agent is crucial as it identifies who or what is responsible for the event. For instance, 'they' in 'they've been building schools' indicates the responsible party.",
            "In some cases, the agent may be implied or not explicitly mentioned. For example, 'production' in 'pharmaceutics production' implies an agent responsible for the production.",
            "The agent can be an individual, group, or organization. For example, 'people' in 'Why would people bother to produce anything on time?' refers to a group of individuals.",

            "Places can range from specific locations to broader regions. For example, 'country' in 'they've been building schools modularly in my country' is a broad region, while 'school' is a specific location.",
