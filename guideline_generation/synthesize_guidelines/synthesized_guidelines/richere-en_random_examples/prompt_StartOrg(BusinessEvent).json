            "The event is characterized by the creation of a new organizational entity, often involving an agent who initiates the process, the organization being created, and sometimes the place where the organization is established.",
            "Unlike the EndOrg event, which signifies the termination or closure of an organization, the StartOrg event focuses on the beginning or establishment of an organization.",
            "Triggers such as 'closed' or 'shut down' are indicative of the EndOrg event type, not the StartOrg event type. The StartOrg event is concerned with the inception and not the cessation of an organization.",
            "The outcomes of the StartOrg event include the formation of a new entity that can operate in various domains such as business, non-profit, or governmental sectors. This event does not cover the operational activities post-establishment, which may fall under other event types like BusinessOperation or Expansion."
