            "The event is triggered by an act of communication between two or more entities, such as a phone call, email, or meeting. Example triggers include 'phoned', 'meet', 'answer', and 'asked'.",
            "The event is characterized by the exchange of information or messages, typically involving a sender and a receiver. It often includes direct interaction or response. Example: 'Phoned Amtrak on Wednesday'.",
            "The event involves a specific form of contact where the primary purpose is to convey or request information. Unlike a Broadcast event, Correspondence is typically more personal and directed at specific individuals or entities. Example: 'Let's see, you quoted my post'.",
            "The event can occur in various settings, including physical locations or virtual platforms. Unlike a Demonstrate event, Correspondence does not involve public displays or protests. Example: 'The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ecuador has informed U.K. authorities'.",
            "The event outcomes include the successful exchange of information or the initiation of further communication. Unlike a Transaction event, Correspondence does not involve the exchange of goods or services. Example: 'Do you recall in YOUR 'The best healthcare in America is government run' thread'."

            "Examples are individuals or organizations involved in the communication. They can be the sender, receiver, or both. Example: 'Patino' and 'William Hague' in 'The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ecuador has informed U.K. authorities'.",
            "The entity argument identifies the participants in the correspondence. It is crucial for understanding who is involved in the communication. Example: 'Amtrak' in 'Phoned Amtrak on Wednesday'.",
            "Entities can be mentioned explicitly or implied through pronouns. Example: 'you' and 'I' in 'Let's see, you quoted my post'.",
            "Entities can include multiple participants, highlighting the interaction between them. Example: 'you' and 'me' in 'Do you recall in YOUR 'The best healthcare in America is government run' thread'.",
            "The entity argument helps distinguish Correspondence events from other ContactEvents by specifying the direct participants. Example: 'company' in 'Phoned online company and got it'."

        "place": [
            "Examples are locations where the correspondence takes place, either physical or virtual. Example: 'London' in 'The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ecuador has informed U.K. authorities'.",
            "The place argument provides context for the setting of the communication, which can be important for understanding the event's circumstances. Example: 'London' in 'Two Italians sisters who spent more than $1 million on celebrity chef Nigella Lawson\u2019s credit cards were acquitted of fraud charges Friday by a London jury'.",
            "Places can be specific or general, depending on the level of detail provided in the text. Example: 'mall' in 'For the same reason the local Glock dealer would not open up a store in the same strip mall where 20 people got shot'.",
            "The place argument helps differentiate Correspondence events from other events that may occur in different settings. Example: 'Massachusetts' in 'In a joint motion, lawyers for the defense and prosecution asked Magistrate Judge Marianne B. Bowler of U.S. District Court in Massachusetts to release Phillipos'.",
            "The place argument is not always present in Correspondence events, but when it is, it adds valuable information about the context of the communication. Example: 'Iowa' in 'President Barack Obama won Iowa Catholics, about a quarter of the electorate, by what the exit polls showed was an 18-percentage-point margin'."
