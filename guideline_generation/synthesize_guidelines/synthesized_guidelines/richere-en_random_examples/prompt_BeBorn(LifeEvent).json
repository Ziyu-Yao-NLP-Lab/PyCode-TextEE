            "Unlike other LifeEvents such as 'Injure', which involve harm or injury, the BeBorn event specifically marks the start of life.",
            "Triggers such as 'born' and 'births' are indicative of the BeBorn event type, not events like 'StartPosition' or 'EndPosition' which relate to job roles.",
            "The outcome of the BeBorn event is the existence of a new person, distinct from events like 'Convict' or 'Sentence' which involve legal judgments."

            "In texts like 'born here in Canada', 'Canada' is the place argument, giving geographical context to the birth.",
            "Edge cases include specific institutions like 'hospital', which still qualify as places where births occur, e.g., 'newborn being placed for adoption in a hospital'.",
            "Unlike the 'destination' in events like 'TransportArtifact', the 'place' in BeBorn is where the birth happens, not where something is being moved to."
