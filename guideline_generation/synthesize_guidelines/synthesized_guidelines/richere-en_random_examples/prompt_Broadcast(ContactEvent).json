            "The event is characterized by the dissemination of information or opinions from an entity to a group of people, often in a formal or public setting. This can include speeches, announcements, reports, and declarations.",
            "Unlike general Contact events, Broadcast events specifically involve the act of conveying information to a broader audience, rather than a one-on-one interaction. For example, 'addressing a group' is a Broadcast event, while 'talking to a friend' is not.",
            "Triggers such as 'addressing', 'call', and 'report' are indicative of Broadcast events, as they involve the act of communicating to an audience. In contrast, triggers like 'stated' in a one-on-one context or 'sued' are not Broadcast events.",
            "The outcome of a Broadcast event is the dissemination of information to an audience, which can influence public opinion, inform, or persuade. This differs from events like 'ArrestJail' or 'Sue', where the outcome involves legal actions and consequences."
