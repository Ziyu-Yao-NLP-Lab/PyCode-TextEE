            "The event is triggered by legal actions where an individual or entity is formally accused of a crime. Example triggers include 'charged', 'indicted', and 'counts'.",
            "The event is characterized by the formal accusation of a crime, typically involving legal authorities such as courts or prosecutors. It is part of the judicial process and often precedes a trial.",
            "Unlike the Convict event, which involves a final judgment of guilt, the ChargeIndict event involves the initial formal accusation. For example, 'charged' indicates the beginning of legal proceedings, not the conclusion.",
            "Triggers such as 'extradite' are indicative of the Extradite event, not the ChargeIndict event. The ChargeIndict event focuses on the formal accusation within a legal jurisdiction.",
            "The event outcomes include the formal documentation of charges against the defendant, which may lead to further legal actions such as trials or plea bargains. It does not include the final judgment or sentencing."
