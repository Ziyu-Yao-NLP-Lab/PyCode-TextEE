            "Unlike the Divorce event, which signifies the dissolution of a marriage, the Marry event signifies the beginning or continuation of a marital relationship.",
            "Triggers such as 'divorce' or 'separate' are indicative of the Divorce event type, not the Marry event type. The Marry event focuses on the union rather than the separation.",
            "The outcome of the Marry event is the establishment or reaffirmation of a marital relationship, which can be contrasted with events like 'Engage' that signify a promise to marry in the future but not the actual union."
