        "description": [
            "The event is triggered by actions or verbs indicating the movement of a person from one location to another. Examples include 'relocate', 'driving', 'go', 'leaving', 'traveled', 'moved'.",
            "The event is characterized by the involvement of a person or group of people being transported, often with a specified origin and destination. Key characteristics include the presence of an agent facilitating the movement, an instrument used for transportation, and the locations involved.",
            "Unlike other MovementEvents, this event specifically involves the transportation of people rather than objects or animals. For example, 'relocate' in the context of moving a person is a TransportPerson event, whereas 'relocate' in the context of moving a company would not be.",
            "Triggers such as 'merge' or 'won' are indicative of BusinessEvent or PersonnelEvent, not this event type. TransportPerson events focus on physical movement rather than organizational changes or achievements.",
            "The outcomes of TransportPerson events typically involve a change in the location of the person(s) involved, which can be contrasted with events like Demonstrate or Appeal, where the focus is on actions taken rather than movement."
