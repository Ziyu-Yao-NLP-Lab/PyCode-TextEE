            "The event is triggered by the act of proposing or appointing someone for a position or role. Example triggers include 'nominate', 'nominated', 'nomination', 'appoint', and 'renomination'.",
            "The event is characterized by the involvement of an agent who proposes or appoints a person for a specific role or position. The scope of the event includes political, organizational, and other formal contexts.",
            "Unlike the 'EndPosition' event, which marks the conclusion of a role, the 'Nominate' event focuses on the initiation or proposal of a role. For example, 'nominated' indicates a proposal, whereas 'resigned' indicates an end.",
            "Triggers such as 'elected' or 'hired' are indicative of 'StartPosition' events, not 'Nominate' events. The 'Nominate' event does not confirm the start of a role but rather the proposal or consideration for it.",
            "The outcome of the 'Nominate' event is the consideration or proposal of a person for a role, which may or may not lead to the actual start of the position. This is distinct from events that confirm the commencement of a role, such as 'StartPosition'."
