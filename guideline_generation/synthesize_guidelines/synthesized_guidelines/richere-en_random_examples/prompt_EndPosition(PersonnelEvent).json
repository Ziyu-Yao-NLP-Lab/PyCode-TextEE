            "The event is characterized by a person ceasing to hold a particular position or job, often due to resignation, termination, or retirement. It involves a clear end to a professional role.",
            "Unlike StartPosition events, which mark the beginning of a new role, EndPosition events signify the end of an existing role. Triggers such as 'started' or 'began' are indicative of StartPosition events, not EndPosition events.",
            "EndPosition events can occur voluntarily, such as 'retired' or 'quit', or involuntarily, such as 'fired' or 'lost'. The key outcome is the cessation of the person's role or job.",
            "This event type does not include transitions to new roles or positions, which are covered by StartPosition events. For example, 'left the law and went to education policy' is an EndPosition event, not a StartPosition event."
