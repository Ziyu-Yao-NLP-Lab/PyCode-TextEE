            "The event is triggered by a formal declaration of guilt by a legal authority. Example triggers include 'convicted', 'found guilty', and 'judgments'.",
            "The event is characterized by the legal determination that an individual or entity has committed a crime. This determination is typically made by a court or similar adjudicative body.",
            "Unlike the 'ChargeIndict' event, which involves the formal accusation of a crime, the 'Convict' event signifies that the accused has been found guilty after a legal process.",
            "Triggers such as 'charged' or 'indicted' are indicative of the 'ChargeIndict' event type, not the 'Convict' event type. The 'Convict' event specifically involves the conclusion of guilt.",
            "The outcome of the 'Convict' event is a legal conviction, which may lead to sentencing or other legal consequences. This is distinct from events like 'TrialHearing', which involve the process of determining guilt, rather than the conclusion."

            "Unlike the 'prosecutor' in the 'ChargeIndict' event, the adjudicator is neutral and responsible for the final judgment.",

        "defendant": [
            "Examples are 'mayor', 'Jacobs', or 'i'. The defendant is the individual or entity that has been found guilty of a crime.",
            "The defendant is central to the 'Convict' event as they are the subject of the conviction. This can include individuals, organizations, or even groups.",
            "In some cases, the defendant may be referred to by their role or title, such as 'the accused' or 'the suspect'.",
            "Unlike the 'plaintiff' in the 'Sue' event, the defendant in the 'Convict' event is the party being judged for a crime.",

            "Examples are 'Salonika', 'London', or 'Afghanistan'. The place is the location where the conviction occurs or is relevant to the event.",

            "In some instances, the place may be implied rather than explicitly stated, such as 'the court in the city found him guilty'.",
            "Unlike the 'destination' in the 'Extradite' event, the place in the 'Convict' event is where the conviction is declared.",
            "Edge cases include situations where the place is a virtual or non-physical location, such as 'online court'."
