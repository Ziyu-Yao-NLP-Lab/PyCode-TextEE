            "The event is characterized by the presence of an attacker, a target, and often an instrument used to carry out the attack. The scope includes any act of aggression or violence, regardless of scale.",
            "Unlike other ConflictEvents, the Attack event specifically involves direct physical harm or the threat of such harm. For instance, 'burned' and 'murder' are indicative of an Attack event, whereas 'closed' (EndOrg) or 'born' (BeBorn) are not.",
            "Triggers such as 'burned' and 'murder' are indicative of an Attack event, not events like 'sued' (Sue) or 'merge' (MergeOrg), which do not involve physical violence.",
            "The outcomes of an Attack event typically include injury, death, or significant physical or psychological harm to the target. This differentiates it from events like 'arrested' (ArrestJail) or 'spent' (TransferMoney), which do not result in direct physical harm."
