    "ArrestJail(JusticeEvent)": {
        "description": "The 'ArrestJail' event type is triggered by actions resulting in the detention or imprisonment of an individual, typically by law enforcement or an authority figure. This event involves the physical apprehension and confinement of a person, leading to the deprivation of their liberty. It is distinct from events involving monetary penalties or legal judgments, focusing specifically on the act of detaining or imprisoning someone. Example triggers include terms like 'arrested', 'busted', 'locked away', and 'jail'. The outcome is the confinement of the individual in a specific place, such as a jail or prison, often following an arrest by law enforcement agents.",
