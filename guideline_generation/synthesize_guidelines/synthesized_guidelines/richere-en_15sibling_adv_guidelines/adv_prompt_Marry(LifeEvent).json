    "Marry(LifeEvent)": {
        "description": "The Marry event is triggered by the act of entering into a legally or culturally recognized union between two individuals, typically referred to as marriage. This event is characterized by the formalization of a relationship, often involving a ceremony and legal documentation, marking the beginning of a marital relationship. Unlike the Divorce event, which signifies the dissolution of a marriage, the Marry event signifies the commencement of a marital union. It can occur in various cultural and legal contexts, but the core aspect remains the formal union of two individuals. Outcomes of the Marry event include the establishment of a legally or socially recognized partnership, often accompanied by changes in legal status, living arrangements, and social roles. Example triggers include 'married', 'marriage', and 'remarried'.",

            "person": "This argument identifies the individuals entering into the marriage, such as 'bride', 'groom', 'spouse', 'partner', 'husband', 'wife', or 'couple'. It specifies the participants in the marriage event. For instance, in 'John and Mary got married', 'John' and 'Mary' are the 'person' arguments. It can also include groups or multiple individuals, such as 'couples', and non-specific references like 'someone' or 'they', if they clearly indicate participants in the marriage. Possessive forms like 'her husband' or 'his wife' are also included.",
            "place": "This argument identifies the location where the marriage event takes place, such as 'church', 'city hall', 'beach', 'Las Vegas', or 'New York'. It provides context about the setting of the marriage event. For example, in 'They got married in Paris', 'Paris' is the 'place' argument. General references like 'in most places' or 'in their hometown' should also be annotated as 'place'. Implied locations, such as 'at the venue' or 'there', should be annotated if the context clearly indicates a location related to the marriage event. Broader geographical references, such as 'country' or 'state', are included if relevant to the marriage event."
