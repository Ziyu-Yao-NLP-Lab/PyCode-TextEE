        "description": "The TransportArtifact (MovementEvent) is triggered by the movement or transportation of an artifact from one location to another. This event involves an agent who facilitates the movement, an artifact being moved, and typically includes the origin and destination locations. Unlike TransportPerson events, which involve the movement of individuals, TransportArtifact events specifically involve objects or items. Example triggers include 'bring', 'deliver', 'take', and 'pull'. The outcome of a TransportArtifact event is the successful or attempted relocation of an artifact.",
