    "ChargeIndict(JusticeEvent)": {
        "description": "The ChargeIndict event is triggered by legal actions where an individual or entity is formally accused of a crime. This event is characterized by the formal accusation stage, typically involving legal authorities such as courts or prosecutors, and precedes a trial or hearing. Unlike the Convict event, which indicates a final judgment of guilt, the ChargeIndict event signifies only the formal accusation. Example triggers include 'charged', 'indicted', and 'counts'. The outcome of this event is the formal charging or indictment of the defendant, which may lead to further legal proceedings, distinct from events like Acquit, which indicate the resolution of charges in favor of the defendant.",
        "attributes": {
            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "adjudicator": "The adjudicator is the legal authority responsible for overseeing the charging or indictment process, such as a court, judge, or jury. They play a crucial role in ensuring that the charges are formally recognized and processed. Examples include 'a judge said Sunday' or 'the court held'. In some cases, the adjudicator may be a collective body, such as a jury. Unlike the prosecutor, who initiates the charges, the adjudicator is responsible for the legal validation and oversight of the charges. Edge cases may include situations where the adjudicator is implied rather than explicitly mentioned, such as 'the decision was made by the court'.",
            "defendant": "The defendant is the individual or entity being formally accused of a crime, such as 'man', 'defendants', 'Sandusky', or 'Jay Z.'. They are central to the ChargeIndict event as the subject of the legal accusation. In some cases, the defendant may be a group of individuals, highlighting the scope of the charges. Unlike the prosecutor, who brings the charges, the defendant is the one facing the charges. Edge cases may include situations where the defendant is referred to indirectly, such as 'the locals charged me'.",
            "place": "The place indicates the location where the charges or indictment are taking place, such as 'Afghanistan', 'Philadelphia', or 'Kabul'. It provides geographical context for the legal proceedings. In some cases, the place may refer to broader regions or countries, helping to understand the jurisdiction and legal context of the charges. Unlike the adjudicator or prosecutor, the place is a geographical reference rather than a legal authority. Edge cases may include situations where the place is implied rather than explicitly stated, such as 'the court in the capital'.",
            "prosecutor": "The prosecutor is the legal authority or entity responsible for bringing the charges against the defendant, such as 'country', 'department', or 'locals'. They play a key role in initiating the ChargeIndict event by formally accusing the defendant. In some cases, the prosecutor may be a collective entity, such as 'the locals', highlighting the involvement of community or governmental bodies. Unlike the defendant, who is the subject of the charges, the prosecutor is the one bringing the charges. Edge cases may include situations where the prosecutor is implied rather than explicitly named, such as 'the decision not to pursue criminal charges'."
