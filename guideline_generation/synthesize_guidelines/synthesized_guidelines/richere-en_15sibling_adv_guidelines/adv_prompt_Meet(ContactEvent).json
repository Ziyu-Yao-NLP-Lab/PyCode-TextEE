    "Meet(ContactEvent)": {
        "description": "A Meet(ContactEvent) is triggered by interactions where two or more entities come together in a physical or virtual space. This event involves direct interaction, unlike Correspondence events, which involve communication through intermediaries. It encompasses both planned and spontaneous interactions, such as meetings, discussions, and encounters, but excludes one-sided communications or broadcasts. Typical triggers include 'meeting', 'discussion', 'approach', and 'asked', while triggers like 'addressing' and 'broadcasting' are not indicative of Meet events. The outcome is usually an exchange of information or social interaction, distinguishing it from other ContactEvent subtypes like Correspondence, which involve written or electronic communication without physical presence.",
        "attributes": {
            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "entity": "The entity argument represents the participants involved in the meeting or interaction. Examples include 'I', 'someone', 'medic', 'lives', 'Condi', 'victim', 'doctor', 'campaigners', 'students', 'one'. Entities can be individuals or groups, and there can be multiple entities in a single Meet event. For instance, 'I' and 'doctor' in 'I had about 20 minutes with a doctor'. In cases where the entity is not explicitly mentioned, it can be inferred from the context, such as 'her' and 'students' in 'I watched her approach a group of students'. Unlike other ContactEvent subtypes, the entity in a Meet event is directly involved in the interaction, not just a recipient of information.",
            "place": "The place argument represents the location where the meeting or interaction takes place. Examples include 'Goerkes Corner' and 'station'. The place provides context about where the Meet event occurs, which can be a physical location or a virtual space. Places can range from specific addresses to general areas, such as 'Goerkes Corner' in 'meeting up with someone there' and 'station' in 'discussion with the campaigners that were standing outside the door of the polling station'. In some cases, the place may not be explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the context, like 'station' in 'discussion with the campaigners'. Unlike other ContactEvent subtypes, the place in a Meet event is where the interaction physically or virtually happens, not just a location mentioned in passing."
