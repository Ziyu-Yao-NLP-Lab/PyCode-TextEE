        "description": "The EndOrg (BusinessEvent) signifies the termination or cessation of an organization's operations, encompassing businesses, schools, political parties, and other entities. This event is triggered by terms such as 'closed', 'belly-up', 'abolished', 'under', 'out', 'closing', 'collapse', and 'failure'. It is distinct from the MergeOrg event, which involves the combination of organizations, and the StartOrg event, which indicates the beginning of an organization's operations. The outcome of the EndOrg event is the complete cessation of the organization's activities, unlike events such as DeclareBankruptcy, where the organization may still exist but is undergoing financial restructuring.",
        "attributes": {
            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "org": "The 'org' argument identifies the organization that is ending. It can refer to various types of organizations such as businesses, schools, and political parties. Examples include 'half' in 'the district closed almost half the schools in the city', 'businesses' in 'small businesses are going belly-up', and 'party' in 'we abolished the political party'. Unlike the 'agent' argument in StartOrg events, which refers to the entity initiating the start, the 'org' argument in EndOrg events refers to the entity that is ceasing operations. Edge cases include ambiguous references where the organization is implied, such as 'hundreds' or 'thousands' in 'hundreds if not thousands will go under'.",
            "place": "The 'place' argument identifies the location where the organization is ending. It provides the geographical context of the event. Examples include 'city' in 'the district closed almost half the schools in the city' and 'mall' in 'the local Glock dealer would not open up a store in the same strip mall'. Unlike the 'place' argument in StartOrg events, which indicates where an organization is starting, the 'place' argument in EndOrg events indicates where an organization is ending. Edge cases include situations where the location is inferred from the context, such as 'other countries' in 'all the platforms went to other countries'."
