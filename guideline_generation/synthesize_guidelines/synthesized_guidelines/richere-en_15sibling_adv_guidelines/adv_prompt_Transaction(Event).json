    "Transaction(Event)": {
        "description": "A Transaction event involves the transfer of goods, services, or money between parties, typically including a giver and a recipient, and sometimes a beneficiary. This event is characterized by a change in ownership or possession of assets, distinguishing it from Contact events, which involve communication without asset transfer. Example triggers include 'owes', 'mugged', 'seized', 'sold', 'take', 'handing out', and 'compensation'. The location of the transaction can also be relevant.",
        "attributes": {
            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "beneficiary": "The beneficiary is the party that gains an advantage or profit from the transaction, even if they are not directly involved in the exchange. For example, in 'the government owes me', 'they' benefit from the transaction. In a seizure, the beneficiary could be the entity that ultimately uses or profits from the seized assets, such as 'ex-sheriff' driving a seized Cadillac. Unlike the recipient, the beneficiary may not directly receive the asset but still gains from the transaction. In negative transactions, such as a mugging, the beneficiary might be the entity that benefits indirectly from the crime.",
            "giver": "The giver is the party that provides or transfers the asset, service, or money in the transaction. For example, in 'the government owes me', the 'government' is the entity providing the asset. In a seizure, the giver could be the original owner of the seized assets, such as 'their' in 'their assets seized'. Unlike the recipient, the giver is the source of the asset being transferred. In negative transactions, such as a mugging, the giver might be the victim who is forced to give up their possessions.",
            "place": "The place is the location where the transaction occurs, providing context to the event. For example, 'campus' in 'someone on my campus is mugged' indicates the location of the transaction. In legal or formal transactions, the place might be a specific institution or geographical location. Unlike the giver or recipient, the place does not participate in the transaction but provides the setting. In cases of online transactions, the place might be a virtual location or platform where the exchange happens.",
            "recipient": "The recipient is the party that receives the asset, service, or money in the transaction. For example, in 'the government owes me', 'me' is the entity receiving the asset. In a seizure, the recipient could be the entity that takes possession of the seized assets, such as 'government' in 'assets seized by the government'. Unlike the giver, the recipient is the endpoint of the asset being transferred. In negative transactions, such as a mugging, the recipient might be the criminal who takes the possessions from the victim."
