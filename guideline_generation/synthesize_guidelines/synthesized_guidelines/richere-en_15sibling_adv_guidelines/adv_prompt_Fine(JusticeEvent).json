    "Fine(JusticeEvent)": {
        "description": "The Fine event is triggered by the imposition of a monetary penalty on an individual or entity as a result of a legal judgment or ruling. This event is characterized by the requirement for the entity to pay a specified amount of money as a penalty for a legal violation, distinguishing it from other JusticeEvents like 'Sentence' or 'ArrestJail', which may involve imprisonment or other forms of punishment. Unlike 'Extradite' or 'Execute', the Fine event does not involve physical relocation or execution of the entity, focusing solely on the financial penalty imposed. Example triggers include 'fines', 'fined', 'return', and 'judgments'. The outcome of the Fine event is the payment or obligation to pay a monetary amount, differing from outcomes like imprisonment (Sentence) or physical relocation (Extradite).",

            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "adjudicator": "The adjudicator is the authority or legal body that imposes the fine, such as 'Supreme Court', 'court', or 'judge'. The adjudicator's role is crucial as they determine the fine based on legal proceedings. For instance, 'The court fined the defendant $5000'. In cases where the adjudicator is not explicitly mentioned, it can be inferred from the context, such as 'The ruling imposed a fine' where the ruling implies a legal authority. Unlike the 'agent' in events like 'ArrestJail', the adjudicator in a Fine event does not physically enforce the penalty but issues the legal mandate for the fine. Edge cases include situations where the adjudicator is a collective body, such as 'The National Assembly passed a bill imposing fines'.",
            "entity": "The entity is the individual or group subjected to the fine, such as 'dictator', 'Chun', 'people', 'man', 'officials', 'father', 'Roh', 'his'. The entity's role is to be the recipient of the fine, meaning they must pay the monetary penalty. For example, 'The company was fined $1 million'. In some cases, the entity may be a collective group or organization, such as 'The corporation was fined for environmental violations'. Unlike the 'defendant' in events like 'Convict' or 'Acquit', the entity in a Fine event is specifically tied to the financial penalty rather than the broader legal judgment. Edge cases include situations where the entity is not explicitly named but can be inferred, such as 'He was fined $200' where 'he' refers to the entity.",
            "place": "The place is the location where the fine is imposed or relevant to the legal proceedings, such as 'South Korea', 'Salonika', 'Massachusetts'. The place's role is to provide context for the jurisdiction or location of the legal authority imposing the fine. For instance, 'The court in New York fined the company'. In some cases, the place may refer to the broader region or country, such as 'The government of South Korea imposed fines'. Unlike the 'origin' or 'destination' in events like 'Extradite', the place in a Fine event is not about movement but rather the location of the legal action. Edge cases include situations where the place is implied rather than explicitly stated, such as 'The local authorities imposed a fine' where 'local' implies a specific place."
