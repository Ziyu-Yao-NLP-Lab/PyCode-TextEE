    "Convict(JusticeEvent)": {
        "description": "The 'Convict' event in the justice system is triggered by the formal declaration of a defendant's guilt in a court of law. This event is characterized by the legal determination that an individual has committed a crime, often leading to a sentence. It involves judicial processes and outcomes, distinct from the 'Sentence' event, which focuses on the punishment. Triggers for this event include terms like 'convicted', 'found guilty', and 'judgments'. It is important to differentiate this from the 'Acquit' event, where the defendant is found not guilty. The outcome of the 'Convict' event is the formal recognition of guilt, potentially leading to subsequent events such as sentencing or appeals, unlike events like 'Pardon', which focus on forgiveness or nullification of the conviction.",

            "mention": "The text span that triggers the 'Convict' event, such as 'convicted' or 'found guilty'.",
            "adjudicator": "The adjudicator is the entity responsible for determining the guilt of the defendant, such as a 'court', 'judge', or 'jury'. This role is crucial in the legal process as they issue the conviction. In some contexts, the adjudicator may be implied rather than explicitly mentioned. Unlike the 'prosecutor', the adjudicator is neutral and makes the final decision on guilt. Edge cases include situations with multiple adjudicators, like 'the jury and judge convicted him'.",
            "defendant": "The defendant is the individual or entity being judged for a crime, such as 'mayor', 'two', 'I', or 'Jacobs'. Central to the 'Convict' event, the defendant's guilt is the focus. The defendant can be a single person or a group, and their identity might sometimes need to be inferred from context. Unlike the 'plaintiff', who brings the case, the defendant is the one being accused and judged.",
            "place": "The place is the location where the conviction occurs, such as 'Salonika', 'London', or 'Massachusetts'. It provides context for the legal jurisdiction and setting of the 'Convict' event. The place may sometimes be implied rather than explicitly stated. Unlike the 'origin' or 'destination' in events like 'Extradite', the place in a 'Convict' event is where the legal decision is made. Edge cases include broader regions, like 'convicted in the United States'."
