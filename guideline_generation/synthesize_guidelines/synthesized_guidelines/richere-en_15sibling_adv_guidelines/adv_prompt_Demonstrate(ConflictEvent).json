        "description": "The Demonstrate event, a type of ConflictEvent, is triggered by actions or gatherings where individuals or groups express their opposition, support, or demand for change, typically in a public setting. This event is characterized by collective actions such as marches, sit-ins, or rallies, aimed at making a statement or drawing attention to a cause. Unlike other ConflictEvent types like 'Attack', the Demonstrate event does not primarily involve direct physical violence or harm. Instead, it focuses on the act of gathering and expressing dissent or support, with outcomes aimed at raising awareness or influencing public opinion. Example triggers include 'protest', 'demonstration', 'crowded', and 'protesters'.",
        "attributes": {
            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event, such as 'protest', 'demonstration', or 'protesters'.",
            "entity": "The entity represents the individuals or groups participating in the demonstration. Examples include 'protesters', 'students', 'organization', 'we', and 'trouble-makers'. The entity is crucial as it identifies who is involved in the demonstration, ranging from specific groups like 'students' to more general terms like 'crowd'. It can also include formal organizations or informal groups, and individuals identified by their actions or roles within the demonstration. In some cases, the entity may be implied rather than explicitly stated, such as 'we held protests' implying 'we' as the participants.",
            "place": "The place represents the location where the demonstration occurs. Examples include 'Yemen/Syrian/Bahrain', 'Sabha', 'house', 'Montreal', and 'Ipanema beach'. The place is important as it provides context and situates the event geographically, ranging from specific locations like 'house' to broader areas like 'Montreal'. It can also include well-known landmarks or public spaces associated with demonstrations, and multiple locations if the demonstration spans different areas. In some cases, the place may be inferred from the context, such as 'students crowded around Paterno's house' implying 'house'."
