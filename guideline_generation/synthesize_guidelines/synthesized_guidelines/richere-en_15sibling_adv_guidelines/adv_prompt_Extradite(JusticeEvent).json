    "Extradite(JusticeEvent)": {
        "description": "The Extradite event involves the legal transfer of a person from one jurisdiction to another for the purpose of legal proceedings or punishment. This event is triggered by terms such as 'extradite', 'extradited', and 'extradition'. It is distinct from other JusticeEvents like 'Pardon' or 'ReleaseParole', as it specifically pertains to the cross-border movement of individuals for judicial reasons. The event typically includes an agent (authority initiating the transfer), a person being extradited, an origin (the starting location), and a destination (the receiving location). The primary outcome is the physical relocation of the individual to face legal actions in another jurisdiction, differentiating it from events like 'Acquit' or 'Sentence' which do not involve such movement.",

            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event, such as 'extradite', 'extradited', or 'extradition'.",
            "agent": "The authority or entity responsible for initiating the extradition process. Examples include 'British' in 'British attempts to extradite him to Sweden', 'U.S. attorneys' in 'his extradition was announced by the U.S. attorneys', and collective entities like 'authorities' in 'he surrendered to Spanish authorities'. The agent is often a government or legal body, such as 'United States' in 'he should not be extradited, noting that U.S. officials have said he could face additional charges'. In some cases, the agent may be implied rather than explicitly stated.",
            "destination": "The location to which the person is being extradited. Examples include 'Sweden' in 'extradite him to Sweden', 'United States' in 'was extradited to the United States', and 'Colombia' in 'he was later sent to Colombia'. The destination can also be inferred from context, such as 'extradited to face charges' where the charges' location implies the destination.",
            "origin": "The location from which the person is being extradited. Examples include 'Ecuadorean' in 'holed up in the tiny Ecuadorean Embassy', 'Colombia' in 'was extradited to the United States from Colombia', and 'Russia' in 'should not be extradited, noting that U.S. officials have said he could face additional charges'. The origin can also be inferred from context, such as 'extradited from Colombia' where the origin is explicitly stated.",
            "person": "The individual being transferred for legal proceedings or punishment. Examples include 'him' in 'extradite him to Sweden', 'Colombian' in 'was extradited to the United States', and 'his' in 'his extradition was announced'. The person can also be inferred from context, such as 'he' in 'should not be extradited, noting that U.S. officials have said he could face additional charges'."
