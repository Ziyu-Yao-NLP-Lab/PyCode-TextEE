    "Acquit(JusticeEvent)": {
        "description": "The 'Acquit' event in the justice system is triggered by a legal decision where a defendant is declared not guilty of the charges against them. This event involves the formal release of the defendant from legal charges, typically following a trial or legal review, and is characterized by the involvement of a legal authority (adjudicator). It is distinct from the 'Convict' event, which results in a guilty verdict, and the 'Pardon' event, which is an act of forgiveness for a crime. The outcome of the 'Acquit' event is the defendant being freed from legal charges, unlike the 'Appeal' event, which involves a request for a higher court to review a lower court's decision. Example triggers include 'acquitted', 'cleared of', 'exonerated', 'overturned', and 'dropped'.",

            "adjudicator": "The adjudicator is the legal authority or body responsible for making the decision to acquit the defendant. This role is crucial as the adjudicator evaluates the evidence and determines the case's outcome. Examples include 'jury', 'judge', 'court', 'high judge', 'appellate court', 'Supreme Court', 'magistrate', 'tribunal', and 'panel of judges'. The adjudicator must be a recognized legal authority with the power to make binding decisions and remains impartial, unlike the 'prosecutor' who brings charges against the defendant.",
            "defendant": "The defendant is the individual or entity being acquitted of the charges. This central figure benefits from the not guilty verdict. The defendant can be a person, a group of people, or an organization. Examples include 'sisters', 'I', 'he', 'you', 'Drew', 'the accused', 'the suspect', 'the company', 'the team', 'the defendant', 'the accused party', 'the individual', and 'the person on trial'. The defendant is distinct from the 'plaintiff' or 'prosecutor', who bring the charges.",
            "place": "The place is the location where the acquittal event occurs, providing context for the legal jurisdiction and setting. It may refer to a city, state, country, or specific court or legal venue. Examples include 'London', 'courtroom', 'Florida', 'city', 'state', 'country', 'Supreme Court', 'district court', 'jurisdiction', 'legal venue', 'court of appeals', and 'trial court'. The place is crucial for understanding the legal framework and authority under which the acquittal is granted, and it differs from the 'origin' or 'destination' in an 'Extradite' event."
