    "ReleaseParole(JusticeEvent)": {
        "description": "The ReleaseParole event is triggered by the act of releasing an individual from custody under specific conditions such as parole or bail. This event involves the transition of a person from confinement to conditional freedom, often involving legal or judicial decisions and stipulations like house arrest or electronic monitoring. It is distinct from the 'Sentence' event, which imposes a penalty, and focuses on granting conditional freedom. Triggers include terms like 'release', 'parole', 'bail', 'let free', and 'paroled'. The outcomes include the individual leaving custody under certain conditions, differing from events like 'Pardon' or 'Acquit'.",

            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "agent": "The agent is the entity that authorizes the release, such as judges, parole boards, or other legal authorities. Examples include 'Marianne B. Bowler' in the context of a judge. The agent plays a crucial role as the decision-maker in the event. In cases where the agent is not explicitly mentioned, it can be inferred from the context. Unlike the 'adjudicator' in the 'Sentence' event, the agent in the 'ReleaseParole' event is specifically involved in releasing the individual. Edge cases include collective entities like 'lawyers for the defense and prosecution' working together to request parole.",
            "person": "The person is the individual being released from custody, such as 'Phillipos', 'criminal', 'she', 'Georges Cipriani', and 'he'. The person is central to the event as the subject of the release, including individuals on bail, parole, or other forms of conditional release. Pronouns like 'he' or 'she' may be used, with context helping to identify the specific individual. Unlike the 'defendant' in the 'Convict' event, the person in the 'ReleaseParole' event is granted conditional freedom. Edge cases include groups like 'two women' or 'a former militant', with context identifying the individuals involved.",
            "place": "The place is the location where the release or parole occurs or where the individual is being released from, such as 'Massachusetts', 'US', 'prison', and 'Ensisheim'. The place provides context to the event, indicating where the legal or judicial action is occurring, including specific locations like a court or prison, or broader areas. Sometimes the place may be implied, such as 'left prison'. Unlike the 'place' in the 'Extradite' event, which involves transfer origins and destinations, the place in the 'ReleaseParole' event focuses on the release location. Edge cases include general areas like 'US' or specific institutions like 'an open prison near Strasbourg'."
