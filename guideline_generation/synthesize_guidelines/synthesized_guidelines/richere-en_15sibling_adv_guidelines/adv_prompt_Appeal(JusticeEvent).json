    "Appeal(JusticeEvent)": {
        "description": "The Appeal event in the justice system is triggered by a formal request to a higher court to review and potentially change the decision of a lower court. This event involves a defendant seeking to overturn a previous judgment, often with the involvement of legal representatives and adjudicators. Unlike the Convict event, which finalizes a judgment, the Appeal event challenges and may reverse it. The outcomes of an Appeal can include upholding, reversing, or modifying the original decision, differing from the Acquit event where the defendant is declared not guilty. The focus of the Appeal event is on the validity of the previous judgment rather than the punishment itself, distinguishing it from the Sentence event.",

            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "adjudicator": "The adjudicator is the authority or body, such as a 'Supreme court' or a panel of judges, that reviews the appeal and makes a decision on it. They play a crucial role in the Appeal event by having the power to uphold, reverse, or modify the original decision. The adjudicator remains neutral and makes decisions based on the law, distinct from the prosecutor who represents the state or public. In some cases, the adjudicator may not be explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the context.",
            "defendant": "The defendant is the individual or entity appealing the previous judgment, central to the Appeal event as they seek to overturn the decision. They may be represented by legal counsel or another representative. The defendant is distinct from the adjudicator and prosecutor, as they are the party challenging the decision. In some cases, the defendant may not be explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the context.",
            "place": "The place is the location where the appeal is being heard or processed, providing context for the jurisdiction and legal framework. It may refer to a specific court or city, such as 'U.S.', 'London', or 'Supreme court'. The place is distinct from the adjudicator and defendant, as it refers to the location rather than the individuals involved. In some cases, the place may not be explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the context.",
            "prosecutor": "The prosecutor is the individual or entity representing the state or public in the appeal process, defending the original judgment and arguing against the appeal. They may be a specific individual or a representative of a larger entity. The prosecutor is distinct from the adjudicator and defendant, as they defend the original decision rather than making or challenging it. In some cases, the prosecutor may not be explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the context."
