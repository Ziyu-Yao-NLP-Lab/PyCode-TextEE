    "BeBorn(LifeEvent)": {
        "description": "The BeBorn event, a type of LifeEvent, is triggered by the birth of a person, marking the beginning of their life. This event is characterized by the introduction of a new individual into the world, often specifying the person and the place of birth. Example triggers include terms like 'born', 'births', and 'newborn'. Unlike other LifeEvents such as 'Marry' or 'Divorce', which indicate changes in marital status, the BeBorn event specifically signifies the start of an individual's life. The outcome of this event is the existence of a new person, contrasting with events like 'Die', which signify the end of a life.",
        "attributes": {
            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "person": "This argument identifies the individual who is being born. Examples include 'I', 'they', 'newborn', and 'children'. It is crucial as it specifies the new life being introduced. For instance, 'I was born in London' identifies 'I' as the person. In cases where the text refers to a group, such as 'children', it still indicates the individuals being born, e.g., 'children born in the 90s'. Edge cases include references to newborns or infants, where the term 'newborn' itself can be the person argument. Unlike events like 'Marry' or 'Divorce', where the person argument involves adults, the BeBorn event focuses on the birth of individuals, often infants or children.",
            "place": "This argument specifies the location where the birth occurs. Examples include 'London', 'Canada', 'hospital', and 'place'. The place argument is important as it provides context to the birth event, indicating where the person was born. For instance, 'born in London' identifies 'London' as the place. In some cases, the place might be a broader region or country, such as 'Canada' in 'born in Canada'. Edge cases include specific institutions like hospitals, where 'hospital' can be the place argument in 'born in a hospital'. Unlike events like 'Marry' or 'Divorce', where the place might be a venue or a city, the BeBorn event's place argument often refers to the birthplace or the location of birth."
