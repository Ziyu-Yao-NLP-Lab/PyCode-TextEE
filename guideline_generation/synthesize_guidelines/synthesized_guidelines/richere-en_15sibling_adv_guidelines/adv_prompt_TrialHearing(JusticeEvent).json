    "TrialHearing(JusticeEvent)": {
        "description": "The TrialHearing event is triggered by legal proceedings where a case is being heard or tried in a court of law. It involves an adjudicator (such as a judge or court), a defendant, and often a prosecutor, and may specify the location of the trial or hearing. This event focuses on the process of the trial or hearing itself, distinct from the 'Sentence' event which focuses on the outcome. Triggers include terms like 'versus', 'v.', 'case', 'trials', 'go to court', 'proven', and 'overruled'. The outcome of a TrialHearing event is not necessarily a conviction or acquittal but involves the presentation and examination of evidence and arguments in court, distinguishing it from events like 'Convict' or 'Acquit'.",

            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "adjudicator": "The adjudicator is the authority presiding over the trial or hearing, responsible for ensuring the legal process is followed and making rulings on the case. Examples include 'Court', 'judge', 'magistrate', and higher courts like 'The Supreme Court'. The adjudicator is neutral and does not advocate for either side, unlike the prosecutor or defendant. In some cases, the adjudicator may be implied, such as in 'The case was heard in court'.",
            "defendant": "The defendant is the individual or entity being accused or sued in the trial or hearing. Examples include 'Miller', 'Aymette', 'guys', 'NBP', and 'he'. The defendant is a key participant as the case revolves around the accusations or charges against them. The defendant may also be a group or organization, such as 'The company was sued for negligence'. Unlike the prosecutor, the defendant responds to the charges, and may be referred to by a pronoun, such as 'He was found guilty'.",
            "place": "The place indicates the location where the trial or hearing is taking place. Examples include 'Tennessee', 'Palermo', and 'court'. The place provides context for the jurisdiction and legal framework under which the trial is conducted. It may refer to a specific court or city, such as 'The hearing took place in the Supreme Court'. Unlike the adjudicator, which refers to the authority, the place refers to the physical or jurisdictional location. The place may also be implied, such as in 'The trial was moved to a different venue'.",
            "prosecutor": "The prosecutor is the individual or entity bringing the charges or accusations against the defendant. Examples include 'United States', 'State', and 'magistrate'. The prosecutor plays a crucial role in presenting the case against the defendant, aiming to prove their guilt. The prosecutor may be a government entity or official, such as 'The state prosecuted the defendant'. Unlike the defendant, who responds to the charges, the prosecutor initiates the legal action. The prosecutor may also be implied, such as in 'The case was brought by the government'."
