    "Divorce(LifeEvent)": {
        "description": "The Divorce event is triggered by any mention or implication of the legal or customary termination of a marriage, including terms like 'divorce', 'divorced', 'separated', and 'Talaq'. It encompasses contexts where the dissolution of a marriage is discussed, regardless of the legal system or cultural practice, and includes both no-fault and fault-based scenarios. This event covers situations where parties are planning, undergoing, or have completed the process of ending their marriage, inferred from legal proceedings or personal declarations. Unlike other life events such as marriage or birth, Divorce marks an end or separation, and does not include broader family disputes or domestic violence unless specifically mentioned in the context of terminating a marriage.",
        "attributes": {
            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "person": "The 'person' argument identifies individuals directly involved or affected by the divorce, such as 'my ex', 'parents', 'they', or specific identifiers like 'Person B'. It captures all parties whose marital status is changing, which could be a single individual or multiple people. Generic or possessive pronouns (e.g., 'our', 'your') are associated with the individuals involved in the divorce. Context is crucial in determining the subjects in complex familial relationships. This argument excludes individuals peripheral to the event (e.g., lawyers, friends) unless they are explicitly stated to be undergoing the divorce themselves.",
            "place": "The 'place' argument refers to geographic or jurisdictional mentions relevant to where the divorce takes place or is recognized, such as 'Michigan' in a no-fault divorce context. It contextualizes the divorce by indicating specific locations that may influence the proceedings or outcome, highlighting legal and cultural variations. Annotations should capture specific place names mentioned in the same sentence or clause as the divorce event. Places mentioned in the narrative background rather than directly linked to the divorce event should not be annotated. In Divorce, the place relates specifically to legal jurisdictions or the residence of the parties involved."
