    "Sue(JusticeEvent)": {
        "description": "The 'Sue' event in the context of justice is triggered by legal actions where one party initiates a civil lawsuit against another. This event involves a plaintiff who brings the case, a defendant who is being sued, and sometimes an adjudicator who oversees the case. Unlike criminal proceedings, the 'Sue' event focuses on civil legal disputes and does not involve criminal prosecution or physical detention. Example triggers include terms like 'sue', 'lawsuit', 'court', and 'civil suit'. The outcome typically involves a legal judgment or settlement.",

            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "adjudicator": "The adjudicator is the entity responsible for overseeing the legal proceedings and making a judgment. Examples include 'court', 'judge', or 'jury'. The adjudicator ensures the legal process is fair and just, and may be a specific judge or a panel of judges. Unlike the defendant or plaintiff, the adjudicator is neutral and does not have a vested interest in the outcome. In some cases, the adjudicator may not be explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the context.",
            "defendant": "The defendant is the party being sued in the legal action. Examples include 'the company', 'the individual', or 'the organization'. The defendant is the target of the lawsuit, and their actions or inactions are being challenged. In some cases, the defendant may be a group of individuals or entities. Unlike the plaintiff, the defendant is on the receiving end of the legal action and must respond to the allegations. The defendant may not always be explicitly named but can be inferred from the context.",
            "place": "The place indicates the location where the lawsuit is filed or adjudicated. Examples include 'England', 'New York', or 'the local court'. The place is important as it can influence the legal jurisdiction and applicable laws. It may refer to a specific court or legal venue. Unlike other arguments, the place provides geographical context and does not directly involve the parties in the lawsuit. The place may not always be explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the context.",
            "plaintiff": "The plaintiff is the party initiating the lawsuit. Examples include 'the authors', 'the union', or 'the family'. The plaintiff brings the legal action and seeks a remedy. In some cases, the plaintiff may be a group of individuals or entities. Unlike the defendant, the plaintiff is the one making the allegations and seeking legal redress. The plaintiff may not always be explicitly named but can be inferred from the context."
