        "description": "The TransportPerson (MovementEvent) is triggered by actions or verbs indicating the movement of a person or group of people from one location to another, such as 'relocate', 'driving', 'go', 'leaving', 'into', 'traveled', and 'moved'. This event involves the voluntary or involuntary movement of individuals, excluding the movement of objects or artifacts. Key details typically include the origin and destination of the movement, the agent facilitating the movement, and the instrument used for transportation. The outcome is a change in the location of the person(s) involved, inferred from the context of the movement described in the text.",

            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "agent": "The agent is the entity responsible for initiating or facilitating the movement of the person. This can be an organization, individual, or group, such as 'government' in 'the government orders a military member to relocate'. The agent is crucial for understanding who or what is causing the movement, even if implied, as in 'I left after being punched', where the agent could be inferred as the person who punched.",
            "destination": "The destination is the location to which the person is moving, such as 'another' in 'relocate from one place to another'. It can be a specific place, country, or general area, like 'mosque' in 'Muslims in lower Manhattan go to a mosque'. The destination helps to understand the goal or endpoint of the movement, even in cases where it is part of a larger area, such as 'country' in 'traveled throughout the country'.",
            "instrument": "The instrument is the vehicle or means used to facilitate the movement of the person, such as 'the car' in 'almost lost control of the car while driving'. It can be a car, plane, train, or method like 'walking' or 'cycling'. The instrument is important for understanding how the movement is being carried out, even if implied, as in 'driving'.",
            "origin": "The origin is the location from which the person is moving, such as 'place' in 'relocate from one place to another'. It can be a specific place, country, or general area, like 'Finland' in 'crossed into Finland'. The origin helps to understand the starting point of the movement, even if implied, as in 'I left after being punched'.",
            "person": "The person is the individual or group of people who are being transported or moving themselves, such as 'member' in 'the government orders a military member to relocate'. The person is crucial for understanding who is undergoing the movement, even if part of a larger group, like 'families' in 'families who moved to England'."
