    "Attack(ConflictEvent)": {
        "description": "The Attack event, a subtype of ConflictEvent, is characterized by actions involving physical harm or violence directed towards individuals or groups. It is triggered by terms such as 'burned', 'spraying', 'murder', 'fired', and 'killers'. The event typically involves an attacker, a target, and often an instrument used to carry out the attack. Unlike other ConflictEvent types like Demonstrate, which involve public protests, Attack events specifically entail direct physical harm or the threat thereof. Outcomes of Attack events usually include injury, death, or significant physical or psychological harm to the target, distinguishing them from other conflict-related events that may not result in such direct harm.",

            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "attacker": "The attacker is the individual, group, or organization responsible for carrying out the attack. Examples include 'they', 'terrorists', and 'killers'. The attacker can be identified through pronouns, specific names, or inferred from context, such as 'terrorists' in 'victims of terrorists'. In some cases, the attacker may be a collective entity like 'the government' or 'the army'.",
            "instrument": "The instrument is the tool or method used to carry out the attack, providing insight into the nature and severity of the event. Examples include 'hot wires', 'CS gas', and 'flash-bang devices'. The instrument can be a physical object or a method, such as 'spraying' implying the use of a substance. In some cases, the instrument may be implied, like 'burned' suggesting fire or a hot object. Unconventional instruments, such as 'psychological torture', should also be annotated.",
            "place": "The place is the location where the attack occurs, helping to contextualize the event. Examples include 'downtown Manhattan' and 'in a basement'. The place can be identified through prepositions like 'in', 'at', or 'on'. It may be a general area or a specific location. Virtual or non-physical locations, such as 'online' or 'in a chat room', should also be annotated as the place.",
            "target": "The target is the individual or group subjected to the attack. Examples include 'her', 'women', 'children', and 'victims'. The target can be identified through pronouns, specific names, or inferred from context, such as 'victims' in 'victims of terrorists'. In some cases, the target may be a collective entity like 'the community' or 'the population'."
