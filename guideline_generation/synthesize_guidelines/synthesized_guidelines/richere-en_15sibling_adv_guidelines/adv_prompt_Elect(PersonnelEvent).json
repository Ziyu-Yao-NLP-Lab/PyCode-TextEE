    "Elect(PersonnelEvent)": {
        "description": "The Elect(PersonnelEvent) is triggered by the selection or appointment of a person to a position or office through a voting process. This event involves a person being chosen for a role, typically through a democratic process, and includes an agent (voters or an organization) and a place where the election occurs. It signifies the final selection or appointment of the candidate, distinct from the 'Nominate' event, which involves proposing a candidate. Triggers such as 'elected', 'won', 're-elected', 'gained', and 'stood' indicate this event, while 'took' or 'Loss' are indicative of 'StartPosition' or 'EndPosition' events, respectively. The event is defined by the actual outcome of an election or voting process, not by the mere proposal or consideration of a candidate.",

            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "agent": "The agent represents the entity or group that conducts the election or votes for the candidate. Examples include 'Catholics' in 'President Barack Obama won Iowa Catholics' and 'people' in 'Our government no longer listens to the people they were elected by'. The agent can be an organization, a group of people, or a specific demographic involved in the election process, such as 'Diebold' in 'The head of Diebold said his mission was to see that Bush was re-elected'. Unlike the 'person' argument, which identifies the individual being elected, the 'agent' argument identifies those who are electing or voting.",
            "person": "The person argument identifies the individual who is the subject of the election or voting process. Examples include 'Barack Obama' in 'President Barack Obama won Iowa Catholics' and 'Bush' in 'The head of Diebold said his mission was to see that Bush was re-elected'. The person can be any individual running for a position or office, such as 'Caroline Lucas' in 'they have gained their first ever MP, Caroline Lucas in Brighton Pavilion'. Unlike the 'agent' argument, which identifies the voters or the group conducting the election, the 'person' argument specifically identifies the candidate.",
            "place": "The place argument identifies the geographical location where the election or voting process takes place. Examples include 'Iowa' in 'President Barack Obama won Iowa Catholics' and 'Ealing' in 'a libertarian stood in an Ealing seat'. The place can be any specific location, such as a city, state, or country, where the election occurs, like 'Brighton' in 'Caroline Lucas in Brighton Pavilion'. Unlike the 'agent' and 'person' arguments, which identify the voters and the candidate respectively, the 'place' argument provides the setting for the election."
