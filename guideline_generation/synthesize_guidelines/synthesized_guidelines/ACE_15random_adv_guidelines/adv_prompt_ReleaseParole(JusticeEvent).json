    "ReleaseParole(JusticeEvent)": {
        "description": "The 'ReleaseParole' event is triggered by the act of releasing an individual from custody or imprisonment, often under specific conditions such as parole. This event involves the transition of a person from confinement to freedom, typically through legal or administrative actions. It is distinct from events like 'Acquit' or 'Pardon', which involve legal judgments, and from 'Execute' or 'Convict', which involve penalties or judgments. The scope includes the conditions of release, such as parole or good behavior, and the entities involved, such as legal authorities or correctional facilities. The outcome usually involves the individual gaining freedom, often with certain restrictions or conditions, differentiating it from events like 'TransferOwnership' or 'TransferMoney'. Example triggers include 'release', 'parole', 'freed', and 'released'.",
        "attributes": {
            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event, such as 'release', 'parole', 'freed', or 'released'.",
            "entity": "This argument represents the entity or organization involved in the process of releasing the individual, such as 'negotiators', 'lawyer', or 'court'. It identifies the authority or body responsible for the release, which could be a legal body, correctional facility, or any organization with the authority to release the individual. For example, 'negotiators' in 'negotiators say he demanded the release of four prisoners'. The entity helps clarify who is facilitating or authorizing the release, distinguishing it from other events where the entity might be different, such as a 'jury' in a 'Convict' event. In some cases, the entity might be implicit but understood to be the authority overseeing the release, like 'the court' in 'the court ordered his release'.",
            "person": "This argument represents the individual being released from custody or imprisonment, such as 'ramzi binalshibh', 'Anwar', or 'Pasko'. It is central to the event as it identifies the subject of the release. The person argument is crucial for understanding who is gaining freedom, for instance, 'Anwar' in 'Anwar, 56, who this week completed four years in prison'. In 'ReleaseParole', the person is typically someone who has been in confinement and is now being released, often under specific conditions. This is different from 'Execute' where the person is subject to capital punishment. The person argument can also include pronouns or references to individuals, such as 'he' or 'who', as seen in 'who was released on parole earlier this year'. Unlike the 'defendant' in events like 'Convict' or 'ChargeIndict', the person in 'ReleaseParole' is the one being freed, highlighting the transition from confinement to freedom.",
            "place": "This argument represents the location from which the individual is being released, such as 'center', 'prison', or 'detention center'. It provides context to the event by specifying where the release is taking place. The place argument is important for understanding the setting of the release, for instance, 'center' in 'we know of one detention center, well over 7,000 Iraqis held there'. In 'ReleaseParole', the place is typically a facility where the individual was confined, such as a prison or detention center. This is different from 'TrialHearing' where the place might be a courtroom. The place argument helps to distinguish the physical location of the release, which is a key aspect of the event. For example, 'prison' in 'completed four years in prison'. Unlike the 'place' in events like 'Meet' or 'Demonstrate', which might refer to locations of gatherings or protests, the place in 'ReleaseParole' specifically refers to the site of confinement and subsequent release."
