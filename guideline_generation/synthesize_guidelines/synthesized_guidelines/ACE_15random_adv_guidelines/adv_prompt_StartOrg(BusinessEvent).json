        "description": "The 'StartOrg' event is triggered by the establishment or creation of a new organization. This event is characterized by the initiation of a new business entity or organization, often involving an agent responsible for the creation and a specific location where the organization is established. Unlike events such as 'Nominate' or 'Elect', which involve assigning roles within existing organizations, 'StartOrg' focuses on the inception of entirely new entities. Triggers such as 'founded', 'created', 'launched', 'opened', and 'built' are indicative of 'StartOrg', whereas triggers like 'appointed' or 'elected' are related to personnel changes within existing organizations. The outcome of the 'StartOrg' event is the existence of a new organization, which differentiates it from events like 'MergeOrg' or 'AcquireOrg', where existing entities are combined or taken over.",

            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "agent": "The agent is the entity or individual responsible for initiating the creation of the new organization. This can be a person, group, or another organization that plays a key role in the establishment of the new entity. In some cases, the agent may be implied or not explicitly mentioned in the text. The agent is crucial for understanding who is behind the creation of the organization, providing context and accountability. Unlike the 'org' argument, which refers to the new entity being created, the agent refers to the initiator of the creation process. Examples include 'Kim Dae-Jung' in 'founded by former president Kim Dae-Jung', 'AIG' in 'AIG is in the final stage of talks to create Japan's sixth largest life insurer', and 'Twentieth Century Fox' in 'he helped launch the Fox Television network'.",
            "org": "The org is the new organization being created or established. This can be a company, political party, group, or any other type of organization. The org is the primary focus of the 'StartOrg' event, representing the new entity that comes into existence. In some cases, the org may be a conceptual or planned entity rather than one that already exists. Unlike the 'agent' argument, which refers to the initiator, the org refers to the entity being created. Examples include 'Millennium Democratic Party' in 'founded by former president Kim Dae-Jung', 'Disneyland' in 'opening a 'sex Disneyland'', and 'network' in 'he helped launch the Fox Television network'.",
            "place": "The place is the location where the new organization is being established. This can be a city, country, or specific venue where the organization is set up. The place provides geographical context to the 'StartOrg' event, indicating where the new entity will operate. In some cases, the place may be implied or not explicitly mentioned in the text. Unlike the 'org' and 'agent' arguments, which refer to the entity and initiator respectively, the place refers to the physical location of the new organization. Examples include 'here' in 'opening a 'sex Disneyland' here', 'Sydney' in 'we are going to build a monster in Sydney', and 'Japan' in 'create Japan's sixth largest life insurer'."
