    "ChargeIndict(JusticeEvent)": {
        "description": "The ChargeIndict event is triggered by legal actions or formal accusations against an individual or entity, typically involving criminal charges. It is characterized by the formal process of bringing charges against a defendant, often initiated by a prosecutor or adjudicator, and involves legal proceedings in various jurisdictions. Unlike the Sentence event, which focuses on the outcome of a trial, the ChargeIndict event centers on the initiation of legal action. This event may involve multiple parties, including the defendant, prosecutor, and adjudicator, and can take place in various locations such as courts or other legal venues. The outcome of the ChargeIndict event is the formal accusation or indictment of the defendant, which may lead to further legal proceedings, but does not cover the final judgment or sentencing phase.",

            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "adjudicator": "The adjudicator is a legal authority, such as a judge or magistrate, responsible for overseeing the legal process and ensuring that charges are formally presented and processed. They play a crucial role in the legal proceedings, remaining neutral and overseeing the process, which may include issuing warrants, overseeing hearings, and making rulings on the charges presented. The adjudicator may be explicitly mentioned or implied in the text.",
            "defendant": "The defendant is the individual or entity formally accused or charged with a crime, and is the primary subject of the ChargeIndict event. They face legal action and are distinct from the prosecutor and adjudicator. The defendant can be an individual or an entity, and their role is central to the event as the legal proceedings revolve around the charges brought against them.",
            "place": "The place refers to the location where the legal proceedings or charges take place, providing context for the jurisdiction and venue of the event. It is not the same as the location of the crime itself but rather where the legal action is initiated or processed. The place can vary widely, from specific courts to broader jurisdictions, and helps identify the legal framework and authority under which the charges are brought.",
            "prosecutor": "The prosecutor is a legal professional or authority responsible for presenting the case against the defendant. They play a key role in initiating and pursuing the charges, gathering evidence, presenting the case, and seeking a legal resolution. The prosecutor is distinct from the adjudicator, who oversees the legal process, and the defendant, who faces the charges. The prosecutor can be an individual, such as a district attorney, or an entity, such as a government agency."
