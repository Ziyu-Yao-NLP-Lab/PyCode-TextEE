    "Sue(JusticeEvent)": {
        "description": "The 'Sue' event, a type of JusticeEvent, is triggered by legal actions where a plaintiff initiates a lawsuit against a defendant. This event is characterized by the formal process of bringing a legal case to court, involving legal terms and references to court proceedings. Unlike other JusticeEvents such as 'Acquit' or 'TrialHearing', the 'Sue' event specifically focuses on the initiation of legal action rather than the outcome or process of a trial. Example triggers include 'lawsuit', 'sued', 'litigation', 'action', and 'claims'. The outcome of this event is the commencement of legal proceedings, which may lead to a trial or settlement, distinguishing it from events like 'Pardon' or 'Execute' that involve the resolution or enforcement of legal decisions.",

            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "adjudicator": "The adjudicator is the authority or body responsible for overseeing the legal proceedings and making judgments. Examples include 'courts', 'judge', and 'Supreme Court'. The adjudicator ensures the case is heard and a fair decision is made, and can include judges, courts, or other legal authorities. Unlike the 'defendant' or 'plaintiff', the adjudicator is not a party to the lawsuit but facilitates the legal process. Edge cases may involve multiple adjudicators or courts, such as 'the courts' or 'various judges', indicating broader legal oversight.",
            "defendant": "The defendant is the party against whom the lawsuit is filed. Examples include 'Iraq', 'Crichton', and 'bankers'. Typically, the defendant is the individual, organization, or entity being accused or sued by the plaintiff, such as companies, government bodies, or specific individuals. In legal texts, the defendant is often mentioned in the context of the accusations or claims made against them. Unlike the 'plaintiff', the defendant responds to the legal action and may need to defend themselves in court. Edge cases may involve multiple defendants or collective entities, such as 'the pair' or 'the company's shareholders', indicating a group being sued.",
            "place": "The place refers to the location where the legal action is taking place or where the lawsuit is filed. Examples include 'Washington', 'United States', and 'court'. The place provides context for the jurisdiction and legal framework under which the lawsuit is pursued, including cities, countries, or specific courts. Unlike other arguments, the place is not a party to the lawsuit but the setting of the legal proceedings. Edge cases may include references to multiple locations or jurisdictions, such as 'foreign courts' or 'various states', indicating a broader geographical context.",
            "plaintiff": "The plaintiff is the party initiating the lawsuit and making the legal claims. Examples include 'relatives', 'survivors', and 'Enron Corp'. Typically, the plaintiff is the individual, organization, or entity that believes they have been wronged and seeks legal redress, such as victims, companies, or specific individuals. In legal texts, the plaintiff is often mentioned in the context of their grievances or the legal action they are pursuing. Unlike the 'defendant', the plaintiff brings the legal action and seeks resolution or compensation through the court. Edge cases may involve multiple plaintiffs or collective entities, such as 'the buyers and sellers' or 'the company's shareholders', indicating a group initiating the lawsuit."
