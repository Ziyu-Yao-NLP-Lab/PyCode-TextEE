    "TransferOwnership(TransactionEvent)": {
        "description": "The TransferOwnership event is triggered by the transfer of ownership of an artifact from one entity to another. This event is characterized by a change in possession or control of an artifact, typically involving a buyer and a seller. Triggers include terms like 'sell', 'buy', 'acquire', 'provide', 'donate', and 'gift', provided they result in a change of ownership. Events such as 'renting', 'leasing', 'lend', or 'borrow' do not qualify as they do not involve a change in ownership. The outcome of this event is the transfer of ownership from the seller to the buyer or beneficiary, distinguishing it from events where ownership does not change, such as 'use' or 'consume'.",
        "attributes": {
            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event, such as 'sell', 'buy', 'acquire', or 'provide'.",
            "artifact": "The artifact is the item or entity whose ownership is being transferred, and it is central to the event. Examples include 'apartment', 'operations', 'hotel', 'property', 'business', 'parks', and 'division'. The artifact can be tangible or intangible and must be clearly identifiable in the text. In cases involving multiple items, each can be considered an artifact if part of the same transaction. Unlike related events, the primary focus here is on the ownership of the artifact.",
            "beneficiary": "The beneficiary is the entity that receives the artifact as a result of the transfer. Examples include 'nanny'. The beneficiary indicates who gains ownership or control of the artifact, which can be an individual or an organization. The beneficiary may not always be explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from context. They are distinct from the buyer as they may receive the artifact without a financial transaction, such as in a gift or donation, and do not necessarily participate in the transaction process.",
            "buyer": "The buyer is the entity that acquires ownership of the artifact through purchase. Examples include 'company', 'Andrew Harris', 'firm', and 'Blackstone Group'. The buyer represents the party that gains ownership in exchange for compensation, typically monetary. The buyer can be an organization or a group and must be clearly identified in the text. Unlike the beneficiary, the buyer is actively involved in the transaction process, often providing payment or other forms of compensation.",
            "place": "The place is the location where the transfer of ownership occurs or is relevant to the transaction. Examples include 'Belgrade', 'Sydney's Kings Cross', 'Florida', 'Spain', and 'Japan'. The place provides context and specificity to the event, indicating where the transaction is taking place or where the artifact is located. It may refer to multiple locations if the transaction involves assets in different areas. The place must be explicitly mentioned in the text and provides important contextual information about the event.",
            "seller": "The seller is the entity that transfers ownership of the artifact to another party. Examples include 'Mirjana Markovic', 'USA Interactive', 'Vivendi', and 'group'. The seller represents the party that relinquishes ownership in exchange for compensation or other considerations. The seller can be an organization or a group and must be clearly identified in the text. Unlike the buyer, the seller initiates the transfer of ownership, often receiving payment or other forms of compensation in return."
