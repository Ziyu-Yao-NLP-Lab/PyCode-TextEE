    "Sentence(JusticeEvent)": {
        "description": "The Sentence event is triggered by a judicial body or authority issuing a formal judgment or punishment to a defendant. This event involves an adjudicator (e.g., court, judge), a defendant (e.g., individual or group being sentenced), and sometimes a place (e.g., country, city) where the sentencing occurs. It specifically pertains to the imposition of a penalty or punishment following a conviction, distinct from the Convict event, which focuses on the determination of guilt. Example triggers include 'sentenced', 'sentence', and 'handed out sentences'. The outcomes of this event include various forms of punishment such as imprisonment, fines, or death sentences, which are distinct from other JusticeEvent types like Execute or Extradite.",

            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "adjudicator": "The adjudicator is the authority that issues the sentence, such as a court, judge, or tribunal. It represents the legal body responsible for the judgment. For example, in 'The Supreme Court sentenced the defendant to life imprisonment', 'Supreme Court' is the adjudicator. The adjudicator can be a specific judge or a general term like 'court'. In cases where the adjudicator is not explicitly mentioned, it can be inferred from context. Unlike the prosecutor in a ChargeIndict event, the adjudicator in a Sentence event delivers the final judgment.",
            "defendant": "The defendant is the party receiving the sentence, such as an individual, group, or organization. This argument identifies who is being punished. For example, in 'The billionaire was sentenced to one year in prison', 'billionaire' is the defendant. The defendant can be a specific person or a group, and may be referred to by pronouns. Unlike the victim in an Injure event, the defendant in a Sentence event is the one being judged and punished by the legal system.",
            "place": "The place indicates where the sentencing occurs, providing context about the jurisdiction and location of the legal proceedings. Examples include 'country', 'city', or 'province'. For instance, in 'A Pakistani court in central Punjab province has sentenced a man to life imprisonment', 'central Punjab province' is the place. The place can be a specific location or a broader region, and may sometimes be implied rather than explicitly stated. Unlike the place in an Extradite event, which indicates the origin and destination of the person being extradited, the place in a Sentence event is where the sentencing occurs."
