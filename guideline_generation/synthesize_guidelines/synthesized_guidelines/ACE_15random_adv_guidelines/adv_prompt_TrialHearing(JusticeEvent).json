    "TrialHearing(JusticeEvent)": {
        "description": "A TrialHearing event, a type of JusticeEvent, involves formal legal proceedings where evidence is examined before a judge or adjudicator, typically in a court setting. This event includes the presence of an adjudicator, a defendant, and often a prosecutor, and aims to determine the guilt or innocence of the defendant. Unlike other JusticeEvents such as 'Pardon' or 'Sentence', the focus is on the examination of evidence and arguments before reaching a verdict. The outcomes can vary, including acquittal, conviction, or mistrial. This event encompasses any formal legal proceeding, such as preliminary hearings, bail hearings, and full trials, regardless of the specific charges or legal system involved. Example triggers include 'trial', 'hearing', 'case', and 'tried'.",

            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "adjudicator": "The adjudicator, such as a judge, court, or jury, is responsible for overseeing the trial or hearing and making legal decisions based on the evidence presented. They ensure the trial is conducted fairly and according to legal standards. The adjudicator can be a specific individual, like 'Judge John S. Martin', or a collective body, such as 'the court'. Unlike the prosecutor or defendant, the adjudicator is neutral and impartial. In some cases, the adjudicator may be inferred from the context, such as 'the trial will start on March 13', implying 'the court'.",
            "defendant": "The defendant, such as 'nichols', 'Anwar Ibrahim', 'wife', 'Markovic', or 'officials', is the individual or group being accused or tried in the trial or hearing. Central to the TrialHearing event, the defendant is the subject of the charges being examined. There may be multiple defendants, each accountable for the charges brought against them. Unlike the prosecutor, who represents the state or accuser, the defendant contests the charges and presents their defense. The defendant may be inferred from the context, such as 'the trial of the former president's wife', where 'wife' is the defendant.",
            "place": "The place, such as 'oklahoma city', 'New York', or 'Belgrade', is the location where the trial or hearing takes place. It provides context for the legal jurisdiction and setting of the trial or hearing. The place can be explicitly mentioned, like 'the Belgrade district court', or inferred from the context, such as 'a federal court in New York'. Unlike the adjudicator or defendant, the place is a static element that does not change throughout the event. It may be implied, such as 'the trial will start on March 13', where the location is the court handling the case.",
            "prosecutor": "The prosecutor, such as 'prosecutors' or 'the prosecution', is the legal representative who brings the case against the defendant in a trial or hearing. They play a key role in presenting evidence and arguments to prove the defendant's guilt, representing the state or accuser. The prosecutor can be a specific individual or a group, responsible for building and presenting the case against the defendant. Unlike the defendant, who defends against the charges, the prosecutor advocates for the conviction based on the evidence. The prosecutor may be inferred from the context, such as 'the judge ruled that enough evidence was presented', implying 'prosecutors'."
