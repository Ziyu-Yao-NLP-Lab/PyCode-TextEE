        "description": "An Attack event, classified under ConflictEvent, involves actions where one party inflicts harm or damage on another, typically through physical violence or destruction. Key triggers include terms like 'killed', 'raping', 'explosion', and 'clashed'. This event is characterized by the presence of an aggressor (attacker) and a recipient (victim or target), often involving the use of weapons or instruments in specific locations. Unlike other ConflictEvents such as Demonstrate, which may not involve harm, Attack events specifically entail harm or the intent to harm. Outcomes usually include injury, death, or significant property damage, distinguishing them from non-harmful events like Transport or TransferOwnership.",
