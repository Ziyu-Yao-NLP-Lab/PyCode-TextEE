        "description": "The Extradite event is triggered by the legal process of transferring a person from one jurisdiction to another for legal proceedings, such as facing charges or serving a sentence. This event involves formal actions by legal authorities and the movement of the individual across jurisdictions. Key triggers include terms like 'extradite', 'extradition', and 'extraditing'. It is distinct from events like 'ArrestJail' and 'ReleaseParole', as it specifically involves cross-jurisdictional transfer rather than initial detention or release from custody.",
