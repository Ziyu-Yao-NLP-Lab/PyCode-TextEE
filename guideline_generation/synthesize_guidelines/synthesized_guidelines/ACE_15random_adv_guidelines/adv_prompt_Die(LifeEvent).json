    "Die(LifeEvent)": {
        "description": "The 'Die' event is triggered by the occurrence of a death, whether it is natural, accidental, or deliberate. It signifies the cessation of life of an individual or group, encompassing scenarios such as murder, suicide, accidental death, and natural death. Unlike related events like 'Injure' or 'Attack', the 'Die' event specifically indicates the end of life. This event can occur in various contexts, including violent conflicts, medical conditions, accidents, and natural disasters. Key triggers include terms like 'killed', 'dead', 'death', 'fallen', 'suicide', 'death toll', and 'executed'.",
        "attributes": {
            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "agent": "The agent is the entity responsible for causing the death. This can be an individual, group, or abstract entity like a disease. For example, in 'A suicide bomber detonated explosives', the 'bomber' is the agent. In cases of accidents, the agent might be an inanimate object or natural force, such as 'earthquake' in 'The earthquake killed many people'. The agent is crucial for understanding the cause of death, distinguishing it from the victim.",
            "instrument": "The instrument is the means or tools used to cause the death. This can be a weapon, substance, or any object used to inflict fatal harm. For instance, 'explosives' in 'A suicide bomber detonated explosives' or 'knife' in 'He was stabbed with a knife'. The instrument specifies how the death was caused, differentiating it from the agent.",
            "person": "The person is the individual whose death is being discussed. This can be directly mentioned, such as 'comrades' in 'The bodies of fallen comrades', or indirectly, such as 'someone' in 'We are talking about someone's life or death'. The person is central to the event as they are the subject of the death, distinguishing them from the agent or instrument.",
            "place": "The place is the location where the death occurred. This can be a specific site, city, country, or any geographical location. For example, 'mall' in 'A suicide bomber detonated explosives at the entrance to a crowded mall' or 'airport' in '19 people were killed in the airport blast'. The place provides context for where the death happened, setting the scene for the event.",
            "victim": "The victim is the individual or group who has died. This can be directly mentioned, such as 'shoppers' in 'A suicide bomber detonated explosives, killing at least four shoppers', or collectively, such as 'victims' in 'The death toll could climb to 30'. The victim is essential for identifying who has been affected by the event, distinguishing them from the agent."
