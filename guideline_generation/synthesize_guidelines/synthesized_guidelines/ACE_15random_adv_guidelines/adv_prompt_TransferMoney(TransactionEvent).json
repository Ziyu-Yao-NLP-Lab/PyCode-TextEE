    "TransferMoney(TransactionEvent)": {
        "description": "The TransferMoney event is triggered by the act of transferring monetary value from one entity to another. This event is characterized by the movement of money between parties, often involving a giver and a recipient, and can occur in various contexts such as donations, payments, fines, and settlements. Unlike the TransferOwnership event, which involves the transfer of physical or intellectual property, the TransferMoney event specifically involves monetary assets. Example triggers include 'give', 'pay', 'fund', 'settle', and 'cost'. The outcome of this event is a change in possession of money for purposes such as compensation, donation, or debt settlement.",

            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "beneficiary": "The beneficiary is the entity that ultimately benefits from the transfer of money. This can be an individual, organization, or group, such as 'Democrats' in political donations or 'neighbor' in compensation cases. In some instances, the beneficiary and the recipient may be the same entity. The beneficiary's role is crucial in identifying who gains from the transaction, even if not explicitly mentioned, as it can often be inferred from the context.",
            "giver": "The giver is the entity that provides the money in the transaction. This can be an individual, organization, or group, such as 'Planned Parenthood' in donations or 'girls' in compensation cases. The giver's role is to identify the source of the monetary transfer, and in some cases, multiple givers may be involved. The giver may not always be explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the context.",
            "place": "The place is the location where the transfer of money occurs or is relevant. This can refer to a geographical location, jurisdiction, or venue related to the transaction, such as 'Colorado' in compensation cases or 'United States' in auction settlements. The place provides context about where the transaction is taking place or has legal relevance, even if not explicitly mentioned.",
            "recipient": "The recipient is the entity that directly receives the money in the transaction. This can be an individual, organization, or group, such as 'Democrats' in donations or 'neighbor' in compensation cases. The recipient's role is to identify who directly gets the money, and in some cases, the recipient and the beneficiary may be the same entity. The recipient may not always be explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the context."
