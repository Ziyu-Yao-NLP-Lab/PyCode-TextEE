    "Meet(ContactEvent)": {
        "description": "The Meet(ContactEvent) is triggered by interactions or gatherings where individuals or groups come together for a specific purpose, such as talks, conferences, forums, negotiations, meetings, briefs, and discussions. This event is characterized by the presence of multiple entities (people or organizations) and typically occurs at a specific location, involving direct communication or exchange of information between participants. Unlike remote communication events like PhoneWrite, the Meet event requires physical presence or direct interaction. It focuses on the act of coming together rather than legal or punitive actions, and its outcome is usually the exchange of ideas, information, or decisions made during the interaction, distinguishing it from ConflictEvents like 'Attack' or 'Demonstrate'.",
