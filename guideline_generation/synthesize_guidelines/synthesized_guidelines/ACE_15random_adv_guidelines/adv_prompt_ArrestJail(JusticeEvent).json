    "ArrestJail(JusticeEvent)": {
        "description": "The 'ArrestJail' event is triggered by actions such as 'arrested', 'held', or 'detained', indicating that a person has been taken into custody by authorities. This event involves law enforcement or other authorities taking a person into custody, often in connection with a suspected crime or legal violation. Unlike the 'Convict' event, which involves a legal judgment of guilt, the 'ArrestJail' event focuses on the act of taking someone into custody, regardless of whether they have been formally charged or convicted. Triggers such as 'arrested' and 'held' are indicative of this event type, distinguishing it from events like 'Sue' or 'Convict', which involve legal proceedings and judgments. The outcome of the 'ArrestJail' event is the physical custody of a person by authorities, differing from events like 'TrialHearing' or 'Sentence' that involve legal processes and decisions.",

            "agent": "The agent is the entity responsible for carrying out the arrest or detention, such as 'Police', 'authorities', or 'law enforcement'. This argument is crucial as it identifies who is enforcing the law. The agent can be a specific organization or a general term for law enforcement. In some cases, the agent may be implied rather than explicitly stated. The agent is not to be confused with the 'person' being arrested. In edge cases where multiple agents are involved, the primary entity responsible for the arrest should be identified.",
            "person": "The person is the individual or group being taken into custody, such as 'her', 'people', 'group', 'he', or 'Lisa M. Montgomery'. This argument is essential as it identifies who is being arrested or detained. The person can be a specific individual or a group of people. In some cases, the person may be referred to by a pronoun or a general term. The person is not to be confused with the 'agent' making the arrest. In edge cases where multiple people are involved, each individual or group should be identified.",
            "place": "The place is the location where the arrest or detention occurs, such as 'Abilene', 'here', 'New York', or 'San Francisco'. This argument is important as it provides context for where the event took place. The place can be a specific city, state, or general location. In some cases, the place may be implied rather than explicitly stated. The place is not to be confused with the 'agent' or 'person' involved in the arrest. In edge cases where multiple locations are involved, the primary location of the arrest should be identified."
