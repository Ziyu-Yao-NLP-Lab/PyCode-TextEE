    "Fine(JusticeEvent)": {
        "description": "The Fine event is triggered by the imposition of a monetary penalty on an individual or entity as a result of a legal or regulatory decision. This event involves the requirement for the entity to pay a specified amount of money, often following a legal judgment or regulatory action. Key characteristics include the presence of an adjudicator and the entity being fined. Unlike other JusticeEvent types such as 'Convict' or 'ChargeIndict', the Fine event specifically involves a financial penalty rather than a criminal charge or conviction. The scope of the event includes the imposition and payment of the fine, but not the underlying legal proceedings that led to the fine. Example triggers include 'fine', 'fined', and 'pay a fine'.",
        "attributes": {
            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event, such as 'fine', 'fined', or 'pay a fine'.",
            "adjudicator": "The adjudicator is the authority or body that imposes the fine, such as a judge, court, or regulatory body like the SEC. They play a crucial role in determining and imposing the fine. Examples include 'The judge ordered the company to pay a fine' and 'The court fined the company'. In some cases, multiple adjudicators may be involved, highlighting the collaborative nature of some regulatory actions. The adjudicator is not the recipient of the fine but the imposer. Edge cases include situations where the adjudicator is implied, such as 'The company was fined'.",
            "entity": "The entity is the individual or organization required to pay the fine, such as a person, company, or any other legal entity. They are the subject of the Fine event, as they are the ones penalized. Examples include 'The company was fined $1 million' and 'The brokerages were fined'. The entity is the recipient of the penalty, not the imposer. Edge cases include situations where the entity is inferred, such as 'He was fined' where 'he' refers to a previously mentioned individual.",
            "place": "The place is the location where the fine is imposed or where the entity is required to pay the fine, such as 'offices', 'court', or 'New York'. It provides context for the Fine event, indicating where the legal or regulatory action is taking place. Examples include 'The fine was imposed in New York' and 'The company was fined at its headquarters'. The place is not a participant in the event but provides contextual information. Edge cases include situations where the place is inferred, such as 'The fine was imposed' where the location is understood to be the jurisdiction of the adjudicator."
