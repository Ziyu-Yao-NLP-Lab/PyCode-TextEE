    "Convict(JusticeEvent)": {
        "description": "The Convict event in the justice system is triggered by the formal declaration of a defendant's guilt in a court of law. This event involves an adjudicator, such as a judge, jury, or court, who delivers the verdict, and a defendant who is found guilty. It is distinct from the Acquit event, which declares innocence, and the Sentence event, which focuses on the punishment following a conviction. The outcome of the Convict event is the formal recognition of guilt, potentially leading to subsequent events like sentencing or appeals, but it does not include the punishment or appeal process itself. Example triggers include 'convicted', 'guilty', and 'conviction'.",
        "attributes": {
            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event, such as 'convicted', 'guilty', or 'conviction'.",
            "adjudicator": "The adjudicator is the entity responsible for delivering the verdict of guilt, such as a judge, jury, or court. This argument is crucial as it identifies the authority behind the conviction. Examples include 'jury' in 'A Manhattan jury convicted Alfred Taubman', 'judge' in 'Judge Shahid Rafiq found Ranjha Masih guilty', and 'court' in 'The court convicted the defendant of fraud'. In some cases, the adjudicator may be inferred from the context, such as 'The defendant was found guilty', where the adjudicator is implied to be the judge or jury.",
            "defendant": "The defendant is the individual or group found guilty of the crime. This argument is essential as it identifies who has been convicted. Examples include specific individuals like 'Alfred Taubman' or 'Anwar Ibrahim', groups such as 'Five of them are Indonesians convicted of murders', and general references like 'Those convicted of murder'. In some instances, the defendant may be inferred from the context, such as 'The man was convicted of blasphemy', where 'man' is the defendant.",
            "place": "The place is the location where the conviction occurs, providing the geographical context of the event. Examples include specific cities or regions like 'Manhattan' in 'A Manhattan jury convicted Alfred Taubman', countries like 'Indonesia' in 'Convicted drug offenders in Indonesia', and specific venues such as 'court' in 'The judge convicted Ayub Masih in the court'. In some cases, the place may be inferred from the context, such as 'The defendant was convicted', where the place is implied to be the location of the court proceedings."
