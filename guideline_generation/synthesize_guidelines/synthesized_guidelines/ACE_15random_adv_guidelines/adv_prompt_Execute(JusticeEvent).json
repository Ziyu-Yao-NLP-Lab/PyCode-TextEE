    "Execute(JusticeEvent)": {
        "description": "The Execute event in the context of justice is triggered by the act of carrying out a death sentence on an individual, typically by a state or legal authority. This event is characterized by the finality of the action, where the individual is killed as a result of a legal decision, distinguishing it from other justice-related events like Pardon or ReleaseParole. Unlike the Die event, which can occur due to various causes, the Execute event specifically involves a legal or judicial process leading to the death of the individual. The scope of the event includes the legal and procedural aspects leading up to the execution, the act itself, and the aftermath, but does not encompass the broader context of the individual's crimes or unrelated legal proceedings. The outcomes of the event are the death of the individual and the legal closure of their case, contrasting with events like Appeal or Convict, where the legal process is ongoing or results in a different form of judgment.",

            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "agent": "The agent is the entity responsible for carrying out the execution, typically a state, country, or legal authority. Examples include 'Texas', 'Indonesia', 'we', and 'Pakistan'. The agent's role signifies the authority under which the execution is performed, which can include government bodies, judicial systems, or specific officials. In cases where the agent is a collective entity (e.g., 'we'), it represents the executing authority or body. Edge cases include situations where the agent is implied rather than explicitly stated, such as 'the state' or 'the country'. Unlike the 'attacker' in the Attack event, the agent in the Execute event operates within a legal framework and authority, emphasizing the judicial nature of the action.",
            "person": "The person is the individual(s) who are being executed. Examples include 'person', 'convicts', 'them', 'six', 'men', 'convict', 'McVeigh', 'Delma Banks', 'he', and 'killer'. The person's role is central to the event as they are the subject of the execution, which can include individuals on death row, convicts, or those sentenced to death. In some cases, the person may be referred to by their role or status, such as 'killer' or 'convict', rather than by name, highlighting their identity in the context of the execution. Edge cases include situations where the person is part of a group or collective, such as 'six' or 'them'. Unlike the 'victim' in the Die event, the person in the Execute event is specifically under a legal death sentence, emphasizing the judicial decision leading to their execution.",
            "place": "The place is the location where the execution is carried out. Examples include 'state', 'Indonesia', 'country', and 'Texas'. The place's role is to provide the geographical context of the execution, indicating where the legal authority is exercised. In some cases, the place may be a broader region or country, such as 'Indonesia' or 'country', rather than a specific location, still providing the necessary context for the event. Edge cases include situations where the place is implied rather than explicitly stated, such as 'the state'. Unlike the 'place' in the Extradite event, which involves the origin and destination of a person being transferred, the place in the Execute event is solely where the execution occurs, emphasizing the finality of the action."
