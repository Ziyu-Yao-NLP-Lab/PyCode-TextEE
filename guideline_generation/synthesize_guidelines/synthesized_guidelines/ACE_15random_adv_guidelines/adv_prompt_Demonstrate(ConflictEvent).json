        "description": "The Demonstrate(ConflictEvent) is characterized by public gatherings or actions where people express their opinions, often in opposition to something. These events typically involve collective actions such as marches, rallies, or protests, with a significant number of participants. Unlike other ConflictEvents, the primary focus is not on direct physical confrontations or violence, although such incidents may occur as secondary outcomes. Triggers for this event include terms like 'rally', 'march', 'protest', 'gathered', and 'campaign', while organized, formal gatherings like 'meeting' or 'conference' are not included. The outcomes often include public awareness, media coverage, and sometimes arrests or clashes with authorities, but the main emphasis is on the act of demonstrating itself.",
