            "The event is triggered by the formal declaration of a defendant's guilt in a court of law. Example triggers include 'convicted', 'guilty', and 'conviction'.",

            "Unlike the 'ChargeIndict' event, which involves the formal accusation of a crime, the 'Convict' event signifies the conclusion of the legal process with a guilty verdict.",
            "Triggers such as 'charged' or 'indicted' are indicative of the 'ChargeIndict' event type, not the 'Convict' event type, which requires a final judgment of guilt.",
            "The outcome of the 'Convict' event is the establishment of the defendant's guilt, which may lead to sentencing, unlike the 'Acquit' event, where the defendant is found not guilty."
