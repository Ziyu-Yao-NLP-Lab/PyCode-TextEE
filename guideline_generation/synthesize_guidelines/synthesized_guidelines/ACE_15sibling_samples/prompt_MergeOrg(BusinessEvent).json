            "The event is triggered by the merging of two or more organizations into a single entity. Example triggers include 'merged', 'merger', 'tying the knot', and 'create'.",
            "The event is characterized by the combination of separate organizations, often to form a larger or more stable entity. This can involve companies, departments, or other organizational units.",
            "Unlike the StartOrg event, which involves the creation of a new organization, the MergeOrg event involves the unification of existing entities. For example, 'opening' is indicative of StartOrg, not MergeOrg.",
            "Triggers such as 'bankruptcy' are indicative of the DeclareBankruptcy event, not the MergeOrg event. MergeOrg focuses on the consolidation of organizations rather than their dissolution.",
            "The outcome of a MergeOrg event is a single, unified organization formed from the merging entities. This is distinct from the EndOrg event, where an organization ceases to exist. For example, 'is no more' is indicative of EndOrg, not MergeOrg."

            "Examples are 'Department of Minority Business Enterprise' and 'Department of Business Assistance' in the context of a merger. The 'org' argument represents the organizations involved in the merging process.",
            "The 'org' argument is crucial as it identifies the entities being combined. For instance, 'Oracle' and 'Peoplesoft' in a merger scenario.",
            "In cases where the text mentions a merger without specifying the organizations, the 'org' argument may be absent. For example, 'he believed in the merger like most other people did.'",
            "The 'org' argument can include various types of organizations, such as companies, departments, or industries. For example, 'Warner Communications' and 'industries' in a merger context.",
            "Edge cases include scenarios where the merging entities are not explicitly named but implied. For instance, 'startups' and 'competitors' in a context of creating larger conglomerates."
