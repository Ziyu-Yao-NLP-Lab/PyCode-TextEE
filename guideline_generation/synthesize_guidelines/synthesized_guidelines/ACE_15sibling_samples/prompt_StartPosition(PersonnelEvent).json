            "The event is triggered by a person starting a new position or role within an organization or entity. Example triggers include 'replace', 'took on', 'begins', 'become', 'took office', 'appointed', 'becoming', and 'became'.",
            "The event is characterized by the initiation of a new role or position by an individual, often marked by formal or official language indicating the start of a tenure. Key characteristics include the mention of the new role, the individual assuming the role, and sometimes the location or entity associated with the role.",
            "Unlike the 'Nominate' event, which involves the proposal of a candidate for a position, the 'StartPosition' event signifies the actual commencement of the role. For example, 'appointed' indicates the start of a role, whereas 'nominated' would indicate a proposal for a role.",
            "Triggers such as 'elected' are indicative of the 'Elect' event type, not the 'StartPosition' event type. The 'Elect' event involves the selection process, while 'StartPosition' focuses on the beginning of the role after the selection process is complete.",
            "The 'StartPosition' event does not include the end of a role, which is covered by the 'EndPosition' event. For instance, 'former' indicates a past role and is not a trigger for 'StartPosition'."

            "The 'entity' argument is crucial as it provides context about the organization or entity associated with the new role. For example, 'Jean-Rene Fourtou' starting a role at the 'unit' indicates the specific entity involved.",
            "In cases where the entity is a broader organization, such as 'China' or 'Beijing', it indicates the larger context within which the new role is situated. For instance, 'Hu Jintao' becoming the leader in 'Beijing' provides a geopolitical context.",
            "The 'entity' argument can sometimes be implicit or inferred from the context. For example, 'operations' in 'Diller took on the role at the top of Vivendi's US entertainment operations' implies the entity is 'Vivendi's US entertainment operations'.",

            "The 'person' argument is essential as it identifies the individual assuming the new role. For example, 'Callum McCarthy' beginning an important job in London's financial world highlights the person involved.",
            "In some cases, the 'person' argument may be a pronoun or a title, such as 'he' or 'minister', which should be resolved to the specific individual mentioned earlier in the text.",
