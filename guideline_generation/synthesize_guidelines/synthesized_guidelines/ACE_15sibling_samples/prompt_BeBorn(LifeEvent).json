            "The event is triggered by the birth or emergence of a person, typically indicated by terms such as 'born', 'birth', 'gave birth', 'removed', 'cut out', or 'having'.",
            "The event is characterized by the introduction of a new individual into the world, often specifying the person being born and sometimes the place of birth.",
            "Unlike other LifeEvents such as 'Die' or 'Marry', the BeBorn event specifically focuses on the beginning of life rather than its end or a significant life change.",
            "Triggers such as 'suicide', 'marry', or 'wounding' are indicative of other LifeEvents like 'Die', 'Marry', or 'Injure', not the BeBorn event type.",
            "The outcome of the BeBorn event is the existence of a new person, which is distinct from events like 'Die' where the outcome is the end of a life, or 'Marry' where the outcome is a change in marital status."

            "In some instances, the 'place' argument may be implicit or not explicitly mentioned, but when present, it adds significant detail to the event.",
            "Unlike the 'place' argument in the 'Die' event, which indicates where a death occurred, the 'place' argument in the BeBorn event specifies the location of birth.",
            "Edge cases include broad or non-specific locations like 'nation', which still qualify as the 'place' argument as they provide a general context for the birth."
