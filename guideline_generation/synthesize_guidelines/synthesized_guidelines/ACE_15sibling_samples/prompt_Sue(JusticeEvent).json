            "The event is triggered by legal actions where one party (plaintiff) initiates a lawsuit against another party (defendant). Example triggers include 'lawsuit', 'sued', 'litigation', 'action', and 'claims'.",
            "The event is characterized by the formal process of bringing a legal case to court, typically involving a plaintiff and a defendant. It often involves seeking a legal remedy or compensation.",
            "Unlike other JusticeEvent types such as 'Appeal' or 'Sentence', the 'Sue' event specifically involves the initiation of legal proceedings by a plaintiff against a defendant, rather than the review or outcome of a case.",
            "Triggers such as 'appealed' or 'sentenced' are indicative of 'Appeal' or 'Sentence' events, not the 'Sue' event type. The 'Sue' event focuses on the commencement of legal action.",
            "The outcome of a 'Sue' event is the initiation of a legal case, which may lead to further legal processes such as trials, settlements, or judgments. It does not encompass the final judgment or sentencing."
