            "The event is triggered by the act of selecting or appointing someone to a position or office through a voting process. Example triggers include 'elected', 're-election', 'elections', and 'by-elections'.",
            "The event is characterized by the formal process of choosing individuals for specific roles, typically within a political or organizational context. It involves a selection mechanism, often through voting or similar democratic processes.",
            "Unlike the 'Nominate' event, which involves proposing a candidate for a position, the 'Elect' event signifies the final decision and appointment of the candidate to the position. For instance, 'name' is indicative of 'Nominate', not 'Elect'.",
            "Triggers such as 'elected' and 're-election' indicate the completion of the selection process, whereas 'Nominate' and 'StartPosition' events involve the initial stages of the process. The outcome of the 'Elect' event is the official appointment of the individual.",
            "The 'Elect' event is distinct from 'EndPosition' events, which denote the conclusion of an individual's tenure in a position. For example, 'former' is indicative of 'EndPosition', not 'Elect'."
