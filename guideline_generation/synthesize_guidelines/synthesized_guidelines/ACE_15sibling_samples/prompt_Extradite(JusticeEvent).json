            "The event is triggered by the act of transferring a person from one jurisdiction to another for legal proceedings or punishment. Example triggers include 'extradite', 'extradition', and 'extraditing'.",
            "The event is characterized by the involvement of legal authorities and the movement of a person from an origin location to a destination location. It often involves formal agreements or legal processes between different jurisdictions.",
            "Unlike the 'ArrestJail' event, which focuses on the act of taking someone into custody, the 'Extradite' event specifically involves the transfer of a person across jurisdictions for legal reasons.",
            "Triggers such as 'release' or 'pardon' are indicative of 'ReleaseParole' or 'Pardon' events, not the 'Extradite' event type. The 'Extradite' event focuses on the legal transfer process rather than the outcome of freedom or clemency.",
            "The outcome of the 'Extradite' event is the person being moved to a new jurisdiction where they will face legal proceedings or punishment. This differs from events like 'TrialHearing' or 'Convict', which focus on the legal proceedings and outcomes within a single jurisdiction."

            "In some cases, the agent may be a specific legal body or authority, such as a tribunal or a specific government department.",
            "Unlike the 'adjudicator' in events like 'TrialHearing' or 'Sentence', the agent in the 'Extradite' event is focused on the transfer process rather than making legal judgments.",

            "In some cases, the destination may be a specific city, state, or country, depending on the legal agreements in place.",
            "Unlike the 'place' argument in events like 'ArrestJail', which indicates where the arrest took place, the destination in the 'Extradite' event indicates where the person is being sent.",

            "In some cases, the person may be referred to by name or by a pronoun, depending on the context of the text.",
            "Unlike the 'defendant' in events like 'TrialHearing' or 'Convict', the person in the 'Extradite' event is specifically being transferred for legal proceedings or punishment.",
