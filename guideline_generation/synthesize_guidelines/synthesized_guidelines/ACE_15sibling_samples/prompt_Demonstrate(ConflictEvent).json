            "The event is triggered by actions or gatherings where people publicly express their opinions, often in opposition to something, such as 'rally', 'march', 'protests', or 'gathered'.",
            "The event is characterized by a collective action or assembly of individuals, typically involving a public display of dissent or support for a cause.",
            "Unlike an 'Attack' event, which involves physical violence or harm, a 'Demonstrate' event focuses on the act of public expression and assembly, even if it may lead to clashes or arrests.",
            "Triggers such as 'rally' and 'march' are indicative of a 'Demonstrate' event, not an 'Attack' event, which would involve terms like 'killed' or 'assaulted'.",
            "The outcomes of a 'Demonstrate' event include public visibility of the cause, potential clashes with authorities, and sometimes arrests, but not direct physical harm as seen in 'Attack' events."
