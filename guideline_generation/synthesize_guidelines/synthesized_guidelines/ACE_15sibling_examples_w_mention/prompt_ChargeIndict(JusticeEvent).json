            "The event is triggered by legal actions where an individual or entity is formally accused of a crime. Example triggers include 'charged', 'accused', 'prosecuted', and 'indicted'.",
            "The event is characterized by the formal accusation of a crime, typically involving legal authorities such as prosecutors or magistrates. It is distinct from events like 'ArrestJail' which focus on the physical detention of a person.",
            "The event involves the initiation of legal proceedings against a defendant, often leading to a trial. Unlike 'Sentence', this event does not involve the final judgment or punishment.",
            "Triggers such as 'charged' and 'accused' indicate this event type, whereas triggers like 'arrested' or 'convicted' are indicative of 'ArrestJail' and 'Convict' events, respectively.",
            "The outcome of this event is the formal recognition of charges against the defendant, which may lead to further legal actions such as trials or plea bargains. It differs from 'Acquit' where the defendant is declared not guilty."

            "Edge cases include phrases like 'facing charges' which are valid triggers, whereas 'under investigation' is not.",
            "Triggers should be specific to the formal accusation process. 'Arrested' is not a valid trigger for this event type as it pertains to physical detention.",
