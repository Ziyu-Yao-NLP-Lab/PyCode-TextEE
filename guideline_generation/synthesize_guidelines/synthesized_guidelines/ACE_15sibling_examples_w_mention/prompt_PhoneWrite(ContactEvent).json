            "The event is triggered by a communication made via telephone or similar device, where the content of the communication is conveyed in the text. Example triggers include 'telephone', 'call', 'told', and 'discussed'.",
            "The event is characterized by the act of conveying information or having a conversation through a phone call. It involves at least one entity making the call and potentially another entity receiving it.",
            "Unlike other ContactEvents such as 'Meet', the PhoneWrite event specifically involves remote communication via a phone or similar device, rather than face-to-face interaction.",
            "Triggers such as 'arrived' or 'met' are indicative of the 'Meet' event type, not the PhoneWrite event type, which focuses on telephonic communication.",
            "The outcome of the PhoneWrite event is the exchange of information or discussion of topics, which is distinct from physical meetings or written correspondence."

        "mention": [
            "The event trigger 'mention' is the word or phrase that indicates the occurrence of the PhoneWrite event. Examples include 'telephone', 'call', 'told', and 'discussed'.",
            "Valid triggers for the PhoneWrite event are verbs or nouns that denote telephonic communication. For instance, 'called' and 'phoned' are valid triggers.",
            "Edge cases include indirect references to phone communication, such as 'said by phone' or 'mentioned over the phone'. These still qualify as valid triggers.",
            "Triggers like 'met' or 'visited' are not valid for PhoneWrite as they imply physical presence, which is not a characteristic of this event type.",
            "In cases where the communication method is implied but not explicitly stated, such as 'he informed her', additional context is needed to confirm it as a PhoneWrite event."

            "Examples are 'spokesman', 'he', 'Bush', 'George W. Bush', and 'Jean Chretien'. These represent the individuals or entities involved in the phone communication.",

            "In cases where multiple entities are involved, all relevant participants should be annotated. For example, 'he and Bush' indicates two entities.",
            "Entities can be referred to by their roles or titles, such as 'President' or 'Prime Minister', as well as by their names.",

        "place": [
            "Examples are 'Agartala'. This represents the location from which the phone communication is made or received.",
            "The 'place' argument is important for providing context about the geographical location related to the PhoneWrite event.",
            "In some cases, the place may be implied rather than explicitly stated. For instance, 'from his office' could be a valid 'place' argument if the office location is known.",
            "Unlike the 'entity' argument, the 'place' argument does not refer to the participants but to the physical location associated with the event.",
            "Edge cases include situations where the place is mentioned in a broader context, such as 'discussed issues of concern in France'. Here, 'France' would be the 'place' argument."
