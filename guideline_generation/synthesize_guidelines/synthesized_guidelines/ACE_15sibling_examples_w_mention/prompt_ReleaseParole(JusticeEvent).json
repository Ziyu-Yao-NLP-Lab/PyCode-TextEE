            "The event is triggered by the act of releasing an individual from custody or imprisonment, often under specific conditions such as parole. Example triggers include 'release', 'released', and 'parole'.",
            "The event is characterized by the transition of a person from being confined to being free, typically under legal or conditional terms. It involves entities such as the person being released and the place of release.",
            "Unlike the 'Pardon' event, which involves forgiveness and removal of penalties, the 'ReleaseParole' event focuses on the conditional release of a person from imprisonment.",
            "Triggers such as 'release' and 'parole' are indicative of this event type, whereas triggers like 'sentences' or 'convicted' are related to other justice events such as 'Sentence' or 'Convict'.",
            "The outcome of this event is the freedom of the person under certain conditions, distinguishing it from events like 'Execute' or 'ArrestJail', which involve the imposition of penalties or confinement."

            "In the context of this event, the trigger must denote the act of freeing someone from custody. For instance, 'released on parole' is a valid trigger.",
            "Edge cases include phrases like 'earliest possible release date', which indicate a future event but still serve as valid triggers.",
            "Triggers must be directly related to the act of release. For example, 'parole hearing' is not a valid trigger as it refers to a procedural event rather than the release itself."
