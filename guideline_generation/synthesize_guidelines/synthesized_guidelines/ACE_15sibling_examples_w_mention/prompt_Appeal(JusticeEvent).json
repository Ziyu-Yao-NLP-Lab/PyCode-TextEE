        "description": [
            "The event is triggered by an individual or group formally requesting a higher court to review and change the decision of a lower court. Example triggers include 'appealed', 'appeals', and 'appeal'.",
            "The event is characterized by the involvement of a higher judicial authority (adjudicator) and the party requesting the review (plaintiff). The scope of the event includes legal contexts where a decision is contested.",
            "Unlike the 'ChargeIndict' event, which involves the formal accusation of a crime, the 'Appeal' event involves challenging an existing decision. Triggers such as 'charges' are indicative of 'ChargeIndict', not 'Appeal'.",
            "The outcome of an 'Appeal' event is a potential review or change of a previous decision, whereas events like 'Execute' result in the enforcement of a sentence. Triggers such as 'executed' are indicative of 'Execute', not 'Appeal'.",
            "The 'Appeal' event differs from 'Acquit' as it involves a request for review rather than a final judgment of innocence. Triggers such as 'acquitted' are indicative of 'Acquit', not 'Appeal'."

            "The event trigger 'mention' is the word or phrase that indicates the occurrence of an appeal. Examples include 'appealed', 'appeals', and 'appeal'.",
            "Valid triggers for the 'Appeal' event include variations such as 'filed an appeal', 'submitted an appeal', and 'appeal for review'.",
            "Edge cases include phrases like 'considering an appeal' or 'planning to appeal', which indicate potential future actions rather than completed events.",
            "Triggers such as 'appeal' in contexts unrelated to legal reviews (e.g., 'appeal to emotions') are not valid for this event type.",
            "The distinction from related events is crucial; for instance, 'appeal' in 'appeal for clemency' is valid, but 'appeal' in 'appeal to the public' is not."

        "adjudicator": [
            "Examples are 'Supreme Court', 'Court of Appeals', 'judge', and 'tribunal'. The adjudicator is the authority reviewing the appeal.",
            "The role of the adjudicator is to reassess the decision made by a lower court. This is a key element distinguishing the 'Appeal' event from initial trials.",
            "In cases where multiple adjudicators are involved, such as a panel of judges, the term 'adjudicator' can refer to the collective body.",
            "Edge cases include situations where the adjudicator is not explicitly named but implied, such as 'the court' or 'the judicial body'.",
            "Unlike the 'TrialHearing' event, where the adjudicator presides over the initial hearing, the 'Appeal' event involves a higher authority reviewing a prior decision."

        "place": [
            "Examples are 'Indonesia', 'Supreme Court', 'New York', and 'federal court'. The place is where the appeal is filed or reviewed.",
            "The place is important as it provides context for the jurisdiction and legal framework within which the appeal is taking place.",
            "In cases where the place is not explicitly mentioned, it can often be inferred from the context, such as 'the court' referring to a known location.",
            "Edge cases include appeals filed in multiple locations, where the primary place of review should be identified.",
            "Unlike the 'Extradite' event, where the place involves origin and destination, the 'Appeal' event focuses on the location of the judicial review."

        "plaintiff": [
            "Examples are 'five', 'their', 'offender', and 'convict'. The plaintiff is the individual or group requesting the appeal.",
            "The plaintiff's role is crucial as they are the party challenging the decision, seeking a review or reversal of the lower court's ruling.",
            "In cases where the plaintiff is a group, such as 'the defendants' or 'the appellants', the term can refer to the collective entity.",
            "Edge cases include situations where the plaintiff is not explicitly named but implied, such as 'the party' or 'the individual'.",
            "Unlike the 'Sue' event, where the plaintiff initiates a lawsuit, the 'Appeal' event involves the plaintiff seeking a review of an existing decision."
