            "Unlike events such as 'Die' or 'Injure', which indicate harm or the end of life, the 'BeBorn' event signifies the start of life.",
            "Triggers such as 'birth' and 'born' are indicative of the 'BeBorn' event type, not events like 'Marry' or 'Divorce', which pertain to changes in marital status.",
            "The event is typically associated with a specific person (the newborn) and sometimes a place (the location of birth), distinguishing it from other life events that may not involve these arguments."

            "The event trigger 'mention' is the word or phrase that indicates the occurrence of the birth event. Examples include 'birth', 'born', and 'delivered'.",

            "Edge cases for triggers might include phrases like 'cut out' in contexts where it clearly refers to a birth event, as in 'cut out of her mother's womb'.",
            "Triggers such as 'wounding' or 'suicide' are not valid for the 'BeBorn' event, as they indicate harm or death rather than birth.",
            "The trigger must directly relate to the act of being born, distinguishing it from related events like 'Marry' or 'Divorce', which involve different life changes."

            "In some cases, the place might be implied rather than explicitly stated, such as 'at her parents' home' indicating 'home'.",
