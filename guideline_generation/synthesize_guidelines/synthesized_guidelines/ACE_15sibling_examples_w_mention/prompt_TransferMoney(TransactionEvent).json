        "description": [
            "The event is triggered by actions involving the transfer of money from one entity to another. Example triggers include 'pay', 'give', and 'transfer'.",
            "The event is characterized by the movement of monetary value, typically involving a giver and a recipient. It is distinct from other transaction events that may involve goods or services instead of money.",
            "Unlike TransferOwnership, which involves the transfer of ownership of physical or intangible assets, TransferMoney specifically involves the transfer of monetary funds.",
            "Triggers such as 'pay' and 'give' are indicative of TransferMoney, whereas triggers like 'sell' or 'provide' are more indicative of TransferOwnership.",
            "The outcome of the event is the successful transfer of money from the giver to the recipient, often with a specified beneficiary and sometimes a place where the transaction occurs."

            "Triggers must clearly indicate the movement of money. For instance, 'pay' in 'pay the bill' is a valid trigger.",
            "Edge cases include phrases like 'settle' in 'settle the debt', which can also indicate a TransferMoney event.",
            "Triggers should not be confused with similar terms used in different contexts, such as 'provide' in 'provide assistance', which does not indicate a TransferMoney event.",
            "Valid triggers must be directly related to the act of transferring money, such as 'donate' in 'donate funds'."

            "The giver can be an individual, organization, or group responsible for the transfer.",

            "The place can be a city, state, country, or any specific location where the event takes place.",
            "In some cases, the place may be implied rather than explicitly stated, such as 'outside the United States' in the example provided.",
