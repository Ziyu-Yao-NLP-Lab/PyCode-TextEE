        "description": [
            "The event is triggered by a business entity formally declaring its inability to pay off its debts, often leading to legal proceedings. Example triggers include 'bankruptcy', 'filed for bankruptcy', and 'declared bankrupt'.",
            "The event is characterized by the involvement of a business organization and often a specific location where the bankruptcy is declared or recognized. It typically involves legal and financial contexts.",
            "Unlike events such as MergeOrg, which involve the combination of two or more organizations, DeclareBankruptcy specifically involves the financial failure of a single organization.",
            "Triggers such as 'merger' or 'acquisition' are indicative of MergeOrg events, not DeclareBankruptcy. The latter is focused on financial insolvency and legal declarations of bankruptcy.",
            "The outcomes of DeclareBankruptcy events often include legal proceedings, restructuring, or liquidation of assets, which differ from the outcomes of events like StartOrg, where a new organization is established."

        "mention": [
            "The event trigger 'mention' is the specific word or phrase that indicates the declaration of bankruptcy. Examples include 'bankruptcy', 'filed for bankruptcy', and 'declared bankrupt'.",
            "Triggers such as 'bankruptcy' and 'bankrupt' are valid indicators of this event type. For instance, 'The company filed for bankruptcy' clearly signals a DeclareBankruptcy event.",
            "Edge cases include phrases like 'considering bankruptcy' which may indicate potential but not confirmed events. The context should confirm the actual declaration.",
            "Unlike triggers for events like MergeOrg ('merged') or EndOrg ('is no more'), DeclareBankruptcy triggers focus on financial insolvency and legal declarations.",
            "Examples of valid triggers include 'bankruptcy', 'filed for bankruptcy', 'declared bankrupt', and 'under bankruptcy laws'. These phrases clearly indicate the financial failure of an organization."

        "org": [
            "The 'org' argument refers to the organization that is declaring bankruptcy. Examples are 'worldcom', 'Enron Corp', and 'amr'.",
            "This argument is crucial as it identifies the entity undergoing financial failure. For instance, 'Enron Corp' in 'Bankrupt energy giant Enron Corp' is the organization declaring bankruptcy.",
            "In cases where multiple organizations are mentioned, the context should clarify which one is declaring bankruptcy. For example, 'united' in 'operating under bankruptcy laws, united posted the best on time performance'.",
            "Unlike the 'agent' argument in StartOrg events, which refers to the entity starting a new organization, 'org' in DeclareBankruptcy refers to the entity facing financial insolvency.",
            "Examples include 'worldcom', 'Enron Corp', 'united', and 'amr'. These organizations are the subjects of the bankruptcy declarations in the provided examples."

        "place": [
            "The 'place' argument refers to the location where the bankruptcy is declared or recognized. Examples are 'united states' in 'went broke on the largest corporate bankruptcy in the united states'.",
            "This argument helps contextualize the event geographically. For instance, 'united states' indicates where the bankruptcy event is taking place or being recognized.",
            "In some cases, the place may not be explicitly mentioned. The context should be used to infer the location if possible.",
            "Unlike the 'place' argument in EndOrg events, which may refer to the location of an organization's end, 'place' in DeclareBankruptcy specifically refers to the location of the bankruptcy declaration.",
            "Examples include 'united states' and other potential locations where the bankruptcy is declared or recognized. These locations provide geographical context to the event."
