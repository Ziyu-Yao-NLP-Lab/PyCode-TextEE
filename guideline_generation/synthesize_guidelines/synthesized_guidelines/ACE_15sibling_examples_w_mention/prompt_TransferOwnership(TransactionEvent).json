            "The event is triggered by the transfer of ownership of an artifact from one entity to another. Example triggers include 'sale', 'sell', 'acquire', and 'providing'.",
            "The event is characterized by the change in possession or control of an artifact, often involving a buyer and a seller. Key characteristics include the presence of an artifact and entities involved in the transaction.",
            "Unlike TransferMoney, this event does not involve the transfer of monetary funds but rather the transfer of tangible or intangible assets. Triggers such as 'gives' are indicative of TransferMoney, not this event type.",
            "The event scope includes any transaction where ownership of an artifact is transferred, regardless of the nature of the artifact or the entities involved. This can include real estate, intellectual property, or other assets.",
            "Triggers and outcomes differ from similar event types in that TransferOwnership specifically involves the change of ownership of an artifact, whereas other events like TransferMoney focus on the transfer of funds without necessarily changing ownership of an asset."

            "Edge cases include phrases like 'hinted it may sell', where the potential for transfer is indicated but not confirmed. These still qualify as valid triggers.",
            "Unlike TransferMoney, where triggers like 'gives' indicate the transfer of funds, TransferOwnership triggers focus on the transfer of an artifact.",

            "Examples are 'apartment', 'operations', 'hotel', and 'them'. The artifact is the item or asset being transferred in the event.",
            "The role of the artifact is central to the event, as it is the object whose ownership is changing. It can be tangible (e.g., real estate) or intangible (e.g., intellectual property).",
            "In the context of the event, the artifact must be clearly identifiable and distinct from other entities involved in the transaction.",

            "In some cases, the beneficiary may not be explicitly stated but can be inferred from the context of the transaction.",

            "In some cases, the buyer may be represented by an organization or a group rather than an individual.",

            "Edge cases include virtual or online transactions where the place may not be a physical location.",
