            "The event is triggered by an official act of forgiving or excusing a person from a legal penalty or punishment. Example triggers include 'pardoned', 'cleared', and 'forgiven'.",

            "Unlike the 'Acquit' event, which involves a legal decision of not guilty, the 'Pardon' event involves forgiving a person who has already been convicted or is serving a sentence.",
            "Triggers such as 'acquitted' or 'released' are indicative of 'Acquit' or 'ReleaseParole' events, not the 'Pardon' event type.",
            "The outcome of a 'Pardon' event is the removal or reduction of legal penalties, whereas similar events like 'Convict' or 'Sentence' result in the imposition of penalties."

            "In cases where the place is not explicitly mentioned, it can sometimes be inferred from the context, such as 'the local court'.",
            "Unlike the 'Extradite' event, where the place involves origin and destination, the 'Pardon' event typically involves a single location.",
