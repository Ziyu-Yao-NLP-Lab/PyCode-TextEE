            "The event is triggered by the movement of people, objects, or entities from one location to another. Example triggers include 'transport', 'drove', 'carting', 'took', and 'back'.",
            "The event is characterized by the involvement of an agent or vehicle facilitating the movement, and an artifact or victim being moved. It often includes a specified origin and destination.",
            "Unlike other MovementEvent types, the Transport event specifically involves the conveyance of entities, often with a clear start and end point. For example, 'transport' indicates a deliberate action of moving something or someone.",
            "Triggers such as 'arrived' or 'departed' are indicative of Arrival or Departure events, not Transport events, as they focus on the endpoints rather than the movement process.",
            "The outcome of a Transport event is the successful relocation of the artifact or victim from the origin to the destination, often involving a vehicle or agent to facilitate the movement."
