        "description": [
            "The event is triggered by the imposition of a monetary penalty on an entity as a result of a legal or regulatory decision. Example triggers include 'fine', 'fines', and 'penalty'.",
            "The event is characterized by the requirement for an entity to pay a specified amount of money, often as a result of a judicial or regulatory ruling. This distinguishes it from other JusticeEvents like 'Sentence' or 'Convict', which may involve imprisonment or other forms of punishment.",
            "The event involves an adjudicator, such as a judge or regulatory body, who imposes the fine on the entity. Unlike 'ArrestJail', this event does not involve physical detention.",
            "The event typically occurs in a legal or regulatory context, where an entity is penalized for violating laws or regulations. This is different from 'Sue', where the focus is on a legal claim rather than a penalty.",
            "The outcome of the event is the payment of a fine by the entity, which is enforced by the adjudicator. This is distinct from 'Pardon', where the outcome is the forgiveness of a penalty rather than its imposition."
