            "The event is triggered by actions involving the apprehension or detention of individuals by law enforcement or other authorities. Example triggers include 'arrested', 'detained', and 'taken into custody'.",
            "The event is characterized by the physical act of taking a person into custody, often in response to alleged criminal activity or civil disobedience.",
            "Unlike the Convict event, which involves a legal judgment of guilt, the ArrestJail event focuses on the initial act of apprehension and detention.",
            "Triggers such as 'convicted' or 'sentenced' are indicative of Convict or Sentence events, not the ArrestJail event type.",
            "The outcome of the ArrestJail event is the temporary or permanent detention of the person, which may lead to further legal proceedings, unlike the ReleaseParole event which involves freeing an individual from custody."
