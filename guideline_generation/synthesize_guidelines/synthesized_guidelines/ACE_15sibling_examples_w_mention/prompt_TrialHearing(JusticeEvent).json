        "description": [
            "The event is triggered by legal proceedings where a defendant is formally tried or heard in a court of law. Example triggers include 'trial', 'hearing', and 'tried'.",
            "The event is characterized by the presence of an adjudicator, such as a judge or court, and often involves a prosecutor and a defendant. It typically takes place in a legal setting.",
            "Unlike the 'ArrestJail' event, which involves the act of detaining a person, the 'TrialHearing' event focuses on the judicial process of determining guilt or innocence.",
            "Triggers such as 'charges' or 'lawsuit' are indicative of 'ChargeIndict' or 'Sue' events, not 'TrialHearing'. The 'TrialHearing' event specifically involves the formal judicial process.",
            "The outcome of a 'TrialHearing' event can lead to various judicial decisions, such as conviction, acquittal, or sentencing, distinguishing it from events like 'Appeal' or 'Pardon', which occur post-trial."
