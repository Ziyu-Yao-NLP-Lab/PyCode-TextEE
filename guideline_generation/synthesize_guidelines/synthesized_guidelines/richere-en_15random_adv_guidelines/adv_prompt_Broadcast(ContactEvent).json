        "description": "A Broadcast(ContactEvent) is triggered when an entity publicly communicates information to an audience. This event involves the dissemination of information or opinions in a formal or public setting, such as speeches, announcements, reports, and declarations. Unlike general Contact events, Broadcast events specifically involve conveying information to a broader audience rather than one-on-one interactions. Example triggers include 'addressing', 'call', 'report', 'declared', 'said', 'speak', and 'edicts'. The outcome of a Broadcast event is the dissemination of information to an audience, which can influence public opinion, inform, or persuade.",
