    "EndOrg(BusinessEvent)": {
        "description": "The EndOrg (BusinessEvent) is triggered by the permanent termination or cessation of an organization or business entity. This event is characterized by the end of operations or existence of an organization, often due to financial difficulties, regulatory actions, or strategic decisions. It encompasses scenarios where businesses shut down, go bankrupt, or are dissolved, leading to the discontinuation of services, loss of jobs, and potential liquidation of assets. Unlike the MergeOrg event, which involves the combination of organizations, the EndOrg event signifies the complete cessation of an organization's activities. Temporary suspensions or pauses in operations do not trigger this event; only permanent closures do. Example triggers include terms like 'closed', 'belly-up', 'abolished', 'collapse', 'failure', and 'permanent closure'.",

            "mention": "The text span that triggers the EndOrg event, such as 'closed', 'belly-up', 'abolished', 'collapse', 'failure', and 'permanent closure'.",
            "org": "The 'org' argument refers to the organization or business entity that is ceasing operations. It is crucial to identify the specific entity affected by the event. Examples include 'schools', 'businesses', 'party', 'dealerships', 'Enron', and 'companies'. In cases where multiple organizations are mentioned, each should be considered part of the 'org' argument. The 'org' argument can include various types of organizations, such as companies, political parties, schools, and dealerships. Edge cases include scenarios where the organization is implied rather than explicitly stated.",
            "place": "The 'place' argument refers to the geographical location where the organization is ceasing operations. It helps contextualize the event within a specific area. Examples include 'city', 'country', or 'region'. The 'place' argument is important for understanding the scope and impact of the EndOrg event. In some cases, the 'place' argument may not be explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the context. Edge cases include scenarios where the location is broad or unspecified."
