    "ChargeIndict(JusticeEvent)": {
        "description": "The ChargeIndict event is triggered by legal actions where an individual or entity is formally accused of a crime. This event is characterized by the formal accusation, typically involving legal authorities such as courts or prosecutors, and is part of the judicial process that often precedes a trial. Unlike the Convict event, which involves a final judgment of guilt, the ChargeIndict event involves the initial formal accusation, marking the beginning of legal proceedings. Triggers such as 'charged', 'indicted', and 'counts' are indicative of this event. The outcomes include the formal documentation of charges against the defendant, potentially leading to further legal actions such as trials or plea bargains, but do not include the final judgment or sentencing.",

            "adjudicator": "The adjudicator is the legal authority or body responsible for overseeing the legal proceedings and ensuring that the charges are formally recorded. Examples include 'court', 'judge', or 'jury'. The adjudicator ensures the charges are legally valid and properly documented, and may be a specific judge or judicial panel, such as 'Judge Smith'. It is distinct from the prosecutor, who presents the case against the defendant. Edge cases include non-traditional legal bodies like military tribunals or international courts.",
            "defendant": "The defendant is the individual or entity being formally accused of a crime. Examples include 'man', 'defendants', or 'Sandusky'. The defendant is the primary subject of the ChargeIndict event, facing the legal accusations. This can include groups or organizations, such as 'defendants' in a collective case. The defendant is distinct from the victim or the prosecutor. Edge cases involve minors or legally incapacitated individuals requiring a legal guardian or representative.",
            "place": "The place is the location where the charges are being filed or where the legal proceedings are taking place. Examples include 'Afghanistan', 'Philadelphia', or 'Kabul'. The place provides context for the legal jurisdiction and setting of the ChargeIndict event, and may refer to a specific court or legal venue. It is distinct from the adjudicator or the prosecutor. Edge cases include virtual or online courts, or proceedings in multiple locations.",
            "prosecutor": "The prosecutor is the legal authority or entity responsible for presenting the case against the defendant. Examples include 'country', 'department', or 'locals'. The prosecutor gathers evidence and formally accuses the defendant, and may be a specific individual or government department, such as the 'Justice Department'. The prosecutor is distinct from the adjudicator or the defendant. Edge cases include international bodies or special prosecutors appointed for specific cases."
