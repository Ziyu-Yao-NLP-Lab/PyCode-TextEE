    "Acquit(JusticeEvent)": {
        "description": "The Acquit event in the justice system is triggered by a legal decision where a defendant is found not guilty of the charges against them. This event involves the formal release of a defendant from legal charges, often following a trial or legal review, and is characterized by the involvement of a legal adjudicator. The scope of this event includes any legal context where charges are dismissed or a verdict of not guilty is reached, across various legal systems and jurisdictions. Unlike the Convict event, which results in a guilty verdict, the Acquit event results in a not guilty verdict. The outcome of the Acquit event is the defendant's release from legal charges, distinguishing it from events like ChargeIndict, which involve the initiation of legal charges.",
