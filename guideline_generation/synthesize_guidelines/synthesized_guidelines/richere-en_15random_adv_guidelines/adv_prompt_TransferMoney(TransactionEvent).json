        "description": "The TransferMoney event is triggered by the act of transferring money from one entity to another, characterized by the movement of monetary value between parties, often involving a giver and a recipient. This event can occur in various contexts such as aid distribution, bonuses, payments, and loans, and includes both physical cash transactions and digital/electronic transfers. It is distinct from TransferOwnership, which involves the transfer of ownership of assets rather than money, and from other financial events like Fine or Sue, which involve legal adjudication or penalties.",
