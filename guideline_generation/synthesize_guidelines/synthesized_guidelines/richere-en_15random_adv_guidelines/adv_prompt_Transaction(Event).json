    "Transaction(Event)": {
        "description": "A Transaction event involves the transfer of assets, goods, or services from one party to another. This event is characterized by the presence of at least two parties: a giver and a recipient. The transaction can be voluntary or involuntary and may include legal or illegal exchanges. Unlike events such as 'Injure' or 'Attack', which involve harm, Transaction events focus on the exchange of items of value, resulting in a change of ownership or possession. Example triggers include 'owes', 'mugged', 'seized', 'sold', 'take', 'handing out', and 'compensation'.",
        "attributes": {
            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "beneficiary": "The beneficiary is the entity that ultimately benefits from the transaction, even if not directly involved. Examples include 'they' in 'the government owes me' and 'ex-sheriff' in 'seized in a drug bust'. The beneficiary may not always be explicitly mentioned and can be inferred from context, such as 'friends' in 'sold off to friends'. In some cases, the beneficiary is a group or abstract entity like 'the public' or 'the community'.",
            "giver": "The giver is the entity that provides or transfers the asset, good, or service in the transaction. Examples include 'government' in 'the government owes me' and 'someone' in 'someone on my campus is mugged'. The giver is always directly involved in the transaction and can sometimes be an abstract or collective entity like 'the government' or 'the police'. The giver may not always be explicitly mentioned and can be inferred from context.",
            "place": "The place is the location where the transaction occurs or is relevant to the transaction. Examples include 'campus' in 'someone on my campus is mugged' and 'country' in 'the E.U. had spent 200 million euros on relief'. The place provides context for the transaction and helps situate it within a specific physical or geographical area. It is not an entity but a location and may sometimes need to be inferred from context.",
            "recipient": "The recipient is the entity that receives the asset, good, or service in the transaction. Examples include 'me' in 'the government owes me' and 'government' in 'assets seized and sold by the Federal government'. The recipient is always directly involved in the transaction and can sometimes be an abstract or collective entity like 'the government' or 'the public'. The recipient may not always be explicitly mentioned and can be inferred from context."
