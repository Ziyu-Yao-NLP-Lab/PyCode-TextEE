        "description": "The StartPosition event is triggered when a person begins a new role or position, often indicated by verbs such as 'start', 'begin', 'take', 'promoted', 'appointed', 'back at work', and 'get'. This event signifies the commencement of a new job, role, or position, typically involving a person and sometimes specifying the associated entity or place. It is distinct from the EndPosition event, which marks the conclusion of a role. The outcome of the StartPosition event is the person assuming a new role, contrasting with events like Nominate, where the person is proposed for a role but has not yet assumed it.",

            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "entity": "The entity argument refers to the organization, company, or specific role that the person is starting. Examples include 'papers' in 'He took two small papers with declining circulation in a small city in South Australia and built a media empire,' 'Captains' in 'promoted Captains,' and 'Attorney General' in 'appointed as his Attorney General.' Unlike the person argument, which identifies the individual, the entity specifies the role or position being assumed.",
            "person": "The person argument identifies the individual who is starting the new role or position. Examples include 'He' in 'He took two small papers with declining circulation in a small city in South Australia and built a media empire,' 'few' in 'promoted Captains,' and 'man' in 'appointed a man who couldn't figure out TurboTax as our Treasury Secretary.' Unlike the entity argument, which specifies the role, the person argument focuses on the individual assuming the role.",
            "place": "The place argument indicates the location where the new role or position is being assumed. Examples include 'city' in 'He took two small papers with declining circulation in a small city in South Australia and built a media empire.' In 'back at work,' if specified, the place could be the workplace or city where the person is returning to work. For 'appointed as his Attorney General,' if the location were specified, it would be included as the place argument. Unlike the entity and person arguments, the place argument provides geographical context to the event."
