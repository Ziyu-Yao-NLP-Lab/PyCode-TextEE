    "Elect(PersonnelEvent)": {
        "description": "The Elect event is triggered by the selection or appointment of a person to a position or office through a voting process or decision. This event involves a person being chosen for a role, often through a formal or informal voting process, and typically includes an agent (voters or an organization) and a place where the election occurs. Unlike other PersonnelEvents, the Elect event specifically pertains to the process of choosing or appointing someone to a position, rather than other forms of personnel changes such as hiring or firing. The outcome of the Elect event is the selection of a person for a role, distinguishing it from events like 'ChargeIndict' or 'Sentence' where the outcome involves legal consequences rather than a position appointment. Example triggers include 'elected', 're-elected', 'won', 'gained', 'stood', 'take', and 'unelected'.",

            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "agent": "The agent represents the group or entity responsible for the election or voting process. Examples include 'Catholics' in 'President Barack Obama won Iowa Catholics' and 'people' in 'Our government no longer listens to the people they were elected by'. The agent can be a group of people, an organization, or a specific electorate, and may sometimes be implied rather than explicitly mentioned. Unlike the 'adjudicator' in JusticeEvents, the agent in Elect events is involved in the voting or selection process rather than making legal judgments.",
            "person": "The person is the individual being elected, such as 'Barack Obama' in 'President Barack Obama won Iowa Catholics' or 'Bush' in 'The head of Diebold said his mission was to see that Bush was re-elected'. The person is the central figure in the Elect event, being chosen for a position or office, and can be a candidate, incumbent, or any individual being considered for a role. Unlike the 'defendant' in JusticeEvents, the person in Elect events is not facing legal action but is being considered for a position.",
            "place": "The place indicates the location of the election or voting process, such as 'Iowa' in 'President Barack Obama won Iowa Catholics' or 'Ealing' in 'a libertarian stood in an Ealing seat'. The place provides context for where the election is taking place, which can influence the event's significance. It can be a city, state, or any geographical location relevant to the election. Unlike the 'place' in events like 'Extradite' or 'TransferMoney', the place in Elect events is specifically related to the location of the electoral process."
