    "Appeal(JusticeEvent)": {
        "description": "The Appeal event in the justice system is triggered by actions or processes where a decision made by a lower court or authority is challenged and reviewed by a higher court or authority. This event involves a defendant seeking to overturn or modify a previous judgment and an adjudicator who reviews the case. It is characterized by legal proceedings and formal requests for reconsideration, distinct from the initial judgment and sentencing. The outcome typically involves the higher court either upholding, reversing, or modifying the original decision, differentiating it from events like Convict or Sue.",
