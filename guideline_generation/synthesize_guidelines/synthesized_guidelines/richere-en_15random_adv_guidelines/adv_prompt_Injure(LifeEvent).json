    "Injure(LifeEvent)": {
        "description": "The 'Injure' event is triggered by actions or incidents that cause non-fatal physical harm to a person. It involves an agent causing harm, a victim receiving the harm, and potentially an instrument used to inflict the injury. The location where the injury occurs can also be specified. Example triggers include 'burned', 'shootings', 'mutilation', 'throwing', 'hit', 'shot', 'injuries', and 'impale'. Unlike the 'Kill' event, the 'Injure' event does not result in the death of the victim, focusing instead on physical harm that may require medical attention but is not fatal. Triggers such as 'extradite', 'meeting', 'addressing', 'divorce', 'born', 'marriage', 'relocate', 'won', 'took', 'convicted', 'building', 'versus', 'bring', 'merge', and 'sued' are indicative of other event types, not the 'Injure' event type.",
        "attributes": {
            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "agent": "The agent is the entity causing the injury, which can be an individual or a group. Examples include 'they' in 'they burned her with hot wires', 'One' in 'One by throwing himself under the wheels', and 'guy' in 'guy who just shot someone else'. The agent is responsible for the action resulting in injury to the victim and is crucial for understanding who is responsible for the injury, which can be important for legal or medical contexts. In some cases, the agent may be implied rather than explicitly stated, such as in passive constructions.",
            "instrument": "The instrument is the object used to inflict the injury, providing context on how the injury was caused. Examples include 'hot wires' in 'they burned her with hot wires' and 'metal spikes' in 'metal spikes to impale anyone'. The instrument can vary widely, from weapons like guns and knives to everyday objects used in harmful ways. In some cases, the instrument may not be explicitly mentioned but inferred from the context. Unlike the agent, the instrument is not a person but an object or tool used by the agent to cause harm.",
            "place": "The place is the location where the injury event takes place, providing geographical context important for legal, medical, or social reasons. Examples include 'where' in 'where they burned her', 'AZ' in 'AZ shootings', and 'mall' in 'mall where the shootings occurred'. The place can be a specific location or more general or implied. It helps in understanding the circumstances of the injury, such as whether it occurred in a public or private setting. Unlike the agent or instrument, the place is a location and not an entity or object involved in causing the injury.",
            "victim": "The victim is the entity receiving the injury, suffering physical harm as a result of the event. Examples include 'her' in 'they burned her', 'female' in 'female genital mutilation', and 'someone' in 'guy who just shot someone else'. The victim can be an individual or a group of people. Understanding the victim is crucial for assessing the impact of the injury event, which may require medical or legal attention. Unlike the agent, the victim is the recipient of the harm, not the perpetrator."
