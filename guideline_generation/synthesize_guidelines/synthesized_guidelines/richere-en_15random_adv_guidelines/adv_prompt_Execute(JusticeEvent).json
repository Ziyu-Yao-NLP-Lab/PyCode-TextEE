    "Execute(JusticeEvent)": {
        "description": "The Execute(JusticeEvent) is triggered by the act of carrying out a death sentence on an individual, typically as a result of a legal or judicial process. This event involves an agent (such as a government or court) enforcing the execution, a person who is the subject of the execution, and often a place where the execution occurs. Unlike other JusticeEvents like 'Pardon' or 'ReleaseParole', this event specifically involves the termination of life as a form of punishment. The outcome is the death of the person being executed, differentiating it from events like 'ArrestJail' or 'ChargeIndict' where the person remains alive. Non-lethal forms of punishment or legal actions that do not result in death are not included in this event type.",
        "attributes": {
            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "agent": "The agent is the entity responsible for carrying out the execution, such as a legal body, government authority, or an individual acting on behalf of the state. Examples include 'court', 'state', 'government', and 'Attorney'. The agent enforces the death sentence, as seen in 'China Executes Nine Uighurs', where 'China' is the agent. If the agent is not explicitly mentioned, it is often implied by the context. The agent must be distinguished from other entities involved in the legal process but not responsible for the execution. Edge cases include collective entities or abstract concepts like 'the state' or 'the government'.",
            "person": "The person is the individual or group subjected to the execution, such as 'man', 'Uighurs', 'people', or '3.5%'. The person is central to the event as their life is being terminated. For instance, in 'China Executes Nine Uighurs', 'Uighurs' is the person. The person may be referred to in a general or collective sense and must be distinguished from other participants in the event who are not being executed. Edge cases include scenarios where the person is referred to by a percentage or group identifier.",
            "place": "The place is the location where the execution takes place, providing context to the event. Examples include 'Afghanistan', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Kabul', and 'Massachusetts'. The place may be a broader region or country rather than a specific location. It must be distinguished from other locations mentioned in the text that are not related to the execution. Edge cases include scenarios where the place is implied or not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the context."
