    "Attack(ConflictEvent)": {
        "description": "An Attack event involves actions that result in physical harm or violence directed towards individuals or groups. It is characterized by the presence of an attacker, a target, and often an instrument used to carry out the attack. The scope includes any act of aggression or violence, regardless of scale, and outcomes typically include injury, death, or significant physical or psychological harm to the target. Example triggers include 'burned', 'spraying', 'murder', 'fired', and 'killers'. This event is distinct from other ConflictEvents as it specifically involves direct physical harm or the threat thereof.",
        "attributes": {
            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "attacker": "The attacker is the entity that initiates the attack, which can be an individual, group, or organization. Examples include 'they' in 'they burned her with hot wires', 'terrorists' in 'victims of the islamist terrorists', and 'killers' in 'think they are killers'. The attacker may sometimes be implicit or inferred from context, such as 'they' in 'they also fired flash-bang devices'. Unlike the 'agent' in events like 'arrested' (ArrestJail), the attacker is the perpetrator of violence, not an enforcer of law.",
            "instrument": "The instrument is the tool or method used to carry out the attack, providing details on how the attack was executed. Examples include 'hot wires' in 'burned her with hot wires', 'CS gas' in 'spraying 9 times the lethal dosage of CS gas', and 'flash-bang devices' in 'fired flash-bang devices'. The instrument may be a substance, weapon, or method, such as 'spraying' in 'spraying 9 times the lethal dosage'. Unlike the 'instrument' in events like 'suicide' (Die), in an Attack event, the instrument is used to inflict harm on others.",
            "place": "The place is the location where the attack occurs, providing context and helping to understand the scope and impact of the attack. Examples include 'where' in 'locked her in a basement, where they burned her', and 'downtown Manhattan' in 'muslim New Yorkers in downtown Manhattan'. The place may be specific or general and can sometimes be implied or inferred from context, such as 'on 9/11' implying the World Trade Center. Unlike the 'place' in events like 'born' (BeBorn) or 'closed' (EndOrg), the place in an Attack event is where the violence or harm takes place.",
            "target": "The target is the entity that suffers the attack, which can be an individual, group, or abstract entity. Examples include 'her' in 'burned her with hot wires', 'women' and 'children' in 'murder and we're talking women and children', and 'victims' in 'victims of the islamist terrorists'. The target may be multiple entities or a collective group and can sometimes be inferred from context, such as 'murdered on 9/11' where the targets are the people who died in the attacks. Unlike the 'victim' in events like 'suicide' (Die), in an Attack event, the target is the one who suffers harm from the attack."
