    "TransferOwnership(TransactionEvent)": {
        "description": "The TransferOwnership event is triggered by the transfer of ownership of an item or property from one entity to another. This event involves a change in possession or control of a tangible or intangible asset, requiring at least two parties: the giver and the recipient. Unlike TransferMoney, this event does not involve the transfer of monetary funds but rather the transfer of ownership of physical or intellectual property. Triggers such as 'inheritance' and 'buying' are indicative of TransferOwnership, while terms like 'paid' or 'transferred funds' are associated with TransferMoney. The outcome of this event is the recipient gaining ownership or control over the item, while the giver relinquishes it. This is distinct from events like Extradite, which involve the transfer of a person rather than ownership of an item.",
        "attributes": {
            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "beneficiary": "The beneficiary is the entity that benefits from the transfer of ownership, even if they are not the direct recipient. Examples include 'THEIR' in 'STOP BUYING THINGS FOR THEIR HOME!'. The beneficiary can be an individual, group, or organization and may be implicit in the context, such as 'they' in 'they didn't get it, but they asked for it.' Unlike the recipient, the beneficiary may not directly receive the item but still gains from the transaction.",
            "giver": "The giver is the entity that relinquishes ownership of the item or property. Examples include 'father' in 'His father having died, he returned to Australia in 1954 to take over his inheritance'. The giver is crucial as it indicates the source of the item being transferred and can be an individual, organization, or entity, such as 'E.U.' in 'Washington had delivered 100,000 metric tons of food and the E.U. had spent 200 million euros on relief.' Unlike the recipient, the giver loses ownership or control over the item.",
            "place": "The place is the location where the transfer occurs or is relevant to the transaction. Examples include 'Adelaide' in 'the Sunday Mail and The News, both of Adelaide'. The place provides context and situates the event geographically. It can be a physical location or a virtual/non-physical location, such as an online marketplace. The place can also indicate where the item originated or where it is being transferred to, such as '7-11' in 'a young teen who bought Skittles from a 7-11'.",
            "recipient": "The recipient is the entity that receives ownership of the item or property. Examples include 'his' in 'he returned to Australia in 1954 to take over his inheritance'. The recipient is key as it identifies who gains control or possession of the item. The recipient can be an individual, group, or organization and may be implicit in the context, such as 'they' in 'they didn't get it, but they asked for it.' Unlike the beneficiary, the recipient directly receives the item or property being transferred.",
            "thing": "The thing is the item or property being transferred. Examples include 'Sunday Mail' and 'News' in 'he returned to Australia in 1954 to take over his inheritance, the Sunday Mail and The News'. The thing is crucial as it is the object of the transaction and what is being transferred from the giver to the recipient. It can be tangible or intangible, such as intellectual property or rights, and can be a single item or multiple items, such as 'planes' in 'The Jihadists have little hope of being able to hijack any more planes so easily.'"
