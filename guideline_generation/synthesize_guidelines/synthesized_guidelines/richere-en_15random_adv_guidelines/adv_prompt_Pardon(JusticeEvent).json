    "Pardon(JusticeEvent)": {
        "description": "The 'Pardon' event in the justice system is triggered by the act of officially forgiving someone for a crime, often resulting in the removal of any remaining penalties or punishments. This event is characterized by an authoritative figure or body (adjudicator) granting forgiveness to an individual (defendant) who has already been convicted of a crime. Unlike the 'Acquit' event, which indicates a legal decision that someone is not guilty, the 'Pardon' event involves forgiving someone who has been found guilty. The outcome of a 'Pardon' event is the absolution of the defendant from the legal consequences of their crime, differing from the 'Sentence' event where a penalty is imposed. Notably, a 'Pardon' can be granted posthumously, meaning it can occur after the defendant's death.",

            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "adjudicator": "The adjudicator is the authoritative figure or body that grants the pardon, such as a governor, president, or legal body. Examples include 'The state of Alabama', 'Ford', and 'governors'. This role signifies the source of legal forgiveness and is responsible for the decision to pardon, distinguishing it from other participants like prosecutors or defense attorneys. For instance, 'Gov. Andrew Cuomo' granting pardons or 'Ford' pardoning 'Nixon'.",
            "defendant": "The defendant is the individual or group that receives the pardon, such as 'Nixon', 'elites', or 'they'. This role identifies who is being forgiven for their crime and can refer to a single person or a group, requiring careful context analysis when pronouns are used. The defendant benefits from the pardon, distinguishing this role from other participants like victims or witnesses. For example, 'Nixon' being pardoned by 'Ford'.",
            "place": "The place is the location where the pardon is granted or relevant to the event, providing geographical context. Examples include 'Alabama', 'London', and 'Afghanistan'. The place can be a specific location, such as a city or state, and may sometimes be implied, requiring inference from the context. It situates the event within a legal or governmental jurisdiction, which is crucial for understanding the authority behind the pardon. Unlike the adjudicator or defendant, the place is a contextual element, not an active participant. For example, 'Alabama' as the place where the pardon was granted."
