        "description": "The ReleaseParole event is triggered by the act of releasing an individual from custody under specific conditions such as parole or bail. It involves a judicial or legal authority (agent) who authorizes the release, the individual being released (person), and the location where the release occurs (place). This event is distinct from other JusticeEvents like 'Acquit' or 'Appeal' as it specifically pertains to the conditional release of an individual rather than a legal judgment or appeal process. The outcome is the physical release of an individual under certain conditions, often involving scenarios where individuals are released from prison, jail, or detention centers with conditions like house arrest, electronic monitoring, or community service. It does not include scenarios where individuals are merely transferred or moved without being released.",

            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "agent": "The agent is the legal or judicial authority responsible for authorizing the release, such as a judge, magistrate, or parole board. For example, 'Magistrate Judge Marianne B. Bowler of U.S. District Court in Massachusetts' identifies 'Marianne B. Bowler' as the agent. The agent plays a crucial role in the event as they have the authority to grant or deny the release. In cases where the agent is not explicitly mentioned, it can be inferred from the context. Edge cases include scenarios where the agent is a collective entity, such as a parole board or a group of officials.",
            "person": "The person is the individual being released from custody, such as a defendant, prisoner, or detainee. For instance, in 'release Phillipos, 19, on $100,000 bail', 'Phillipos' is the person. The person is the central figure in the event as they are the subject of the release. In cases where the person is not explicitly named, it can be inferred from the context. Edge cases include scenarios where the person is referred to by a pronoun or a general term.",
            "place": "The place is the location where the release occurs or where the person is being released to, such as a prison, jail, or a specific geographic location. For example, in 'U.S. District Court in Massachusetts', 'Massachusetts' is the place. The place provides context to the event by indicating where the release is taking place. In cases where the place is not explicitly mentioned, it can be inferred from the context. Edge cases include scenarios where the place is a general term or a specific facility."
