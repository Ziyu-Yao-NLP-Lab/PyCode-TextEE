    "Fine(JusticeEvent)": {
        "description": "The Fine event in the context of justice is triggered by the imposition of a monetary penalty on an individual or entity as a result of a legal judgment or ruling. This event is characterized by the requirement for the entity to pay a specified amount of money, often as a punishment for a legal or regulatory violation. It is distinct from other justice-related events such as 'Sue' or 'Acquit', which involve different legal processes and outcomes. Typical triggers for this event include terms like 'fines', 'fined', 'return', and 'judgments'. The Fine event specifically involves the outcome of a legal process where a financial penalty is imposed, differentiating it from events like 'Extradite' or 'Pardon', which involve different legal actions and outcomes, and from events like 'DeclareBankruptcy' or 'MergeOrg', which involve financial or organizational changes rather than penalties.",

            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "adjudicator": "The adjudicator is the authority or body that imposes the fine, such as a court, judge, or legal authority. Examples include 'Supreme Court', 'jury', and 'judge'. This argument is crucial as it identifies the source of the legal decision. In cases where the adjudicator is not explicitly mentioned, it can be inferred from the context, such as 'the court' or 'the judge'. The adjudicator's role is to enforce the legal penalty, distinguishing it from other participants in the event.",
            "entity": "The entity is the individual or organization that is being fined. This argument is essential as it identifies the recipient of the fine. Examples include 'dictator', 'Chun', 'people', 'man', 'officials', 'father', 'Roh', and 'his'. The entity can be a person, a group of people, or an organization. In some cases, the entity may be referred to indirectly, such as 'his' in 'Chun has so far paid only a quarter of his fine...'. The entity's role is to be the recipient of the monetary penalty, distinguishing it from other participants in the event.",
            "place": "The place is the location where the fine is imposed or relevant to the event. This argument is important as it provides the geographical context of the event. Examples include 'South Korea', 'England', 'Adelaide', 'Michigan', and 'places'. The place can be a country, city, or specific location. In some cases, the place may be implied rather than explicitly stated, such as 'the country' in 'the children of a former military dictator of South Korea...'. The place's role is to situate the event geographically, distinguishing it from other elements of the event."
