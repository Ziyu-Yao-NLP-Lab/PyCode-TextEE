    "Die(LifeEvent)": {
        "description": "The 'Die' event is triggered by the occurrence of a death, whether natural, accidental, or intentional. It signifies the end of life of one or more individuals, encompassing various causes such as homicides, accidents, and natural causes. Unlike related events like 'Injure' or 'Execute', the 'Die' event specifically denotes the cessation of life. Triggers such as 'suicide', 'murder', 'killing', 'blown up', and 'victims' are indicative of this event. The outcome is the death of the victim(s), distinguishing it from events where the victim survives but is harmed.",
