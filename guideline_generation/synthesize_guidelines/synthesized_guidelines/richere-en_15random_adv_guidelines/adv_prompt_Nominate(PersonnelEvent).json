    "Nominate(PersonnelEvent)": {
        "description": "The Nominate event, a type of PersonnelEvent, is triggered by the act of proposing or appointing someone for a position or role. This event involves an agent who initiates the nomination process, which can occur in political, organizational, or other formal contexts. Unlike the EndPosition event, which marks the conclusion of a role, the Nominate event focuses on the proposal or consideration for a role, without confirming the start of the position. Example triggers include 'nominate', 'nominated', 'nomination', 'appoint', and 'renomination'. The outcome of this event is the consideration of a person for a role, which may or may not lead to the actual commencement of the position, distinguishing it from events like StartPosition that confirm the beginning of a role.",

            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "agent": "The agent is the entity or individual responsible for proposing or appointing the person for the role. Examples include 'republican', 'party', 'Obama', 'Deval Patrick', and 'Republicans'. The agent initiates the nomination process and can be a political party, an individual, or an organization. In some cases, the agent may not be explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the context. The agent is distinct from the person being nominated, although in self-nomination cases, the agent and the person are the same.",
            "person": "The person is the individual being proposed or appointed for the role. Examples include 'Bush Jr', 'Kerry', 'Mishaal', 'people', 'Chairman', 'Ryan', 'Jr.', and 'nominee'. The person is the central focus of the nomination event and may be referred to by their title or role rather than their name. The person is distinct from the agent, although collective nominations can involve groups of individuals.",
            "place": "The place is the location where the nomination event occurs or is relevant to. Examples include 'New York'. The place provides context to the nomination event, indicating where the nomination is taking place or where the nominated person is expected to serve. In some cases, the place may not be explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the context. The place is distinct from the agent and the person, and can include virtual or non-physical locations."
