    "Divorce(LifeEvent)": {
        "description": "The Divorce event, a type of LifeEvent, is triggered by the legal or formal dissolution of a marriage or marital union. This event signifies the end of a marital relationship, typically involving legal proceedings or mutual agreement between two previously married individuals. Common triggers include terms like 'divorce', 'divorced', 'separated', and 'Talaq'. Unlike other LifeEvents such as 'Marriage' or 'Birth', which mark the beginning of a relationship or the addition of a family member, Divorce indicates the termination of a marital relationship. The outcomes often involve changes in legal status, living arrangements, and financial responsibilities, distinguishing it from events like 'Sue' or 'DeclareBankruptcy'. It is important to note that triggers for this event are specific to the dissolution of marriage and do not overlap with events involving legal or physical conflict, such as 'ArrestJail' or 'Attack'.",

            "person": "The 'person' argument identifies the individuals involved in the divorce. Examples include 'our' in 'our divorce', 'parents' in 'my parents divorced', and 'he' and 'mum' in 'he divorced your mum'. This argument is crucial as it specifies the parties whose marital relationship is being dissolved. It can refer to one or both individuals in the marriage. In cases where multiple people are mentioned, such as 'my ex' and 'I', both are considered 'person' arguments. Edge cases include pronouns or possessive forms like 'your' in 'your divorce' or 'they' in 'they divorce'. Unlike events like 'ArrestJail', where 'person' might refer to the arrested individual, in the Divorce event, 'person' specifically refers to the individuals whose marriage is ending.",
            "place": "The 'place' argument identifies the location where the divorce is taking place or the relevant legal jurisdiction. Examples include 'Michigan' in 'Michigan is a no-fault divorce state' and 'England' in 'sued him over it in England'. This argument provides context about the legal environment or geographical setting of the divorce, which can influence the proceedings. In some cases, the 'place' might be implied rather than explicitly stated, such as 'in this state' or 'here'. These references still qualify as 'place' arguments if they indicate a location. Edge cases include situations where the place is mentioned in relation to other events, such as 'divorced in Michigan' versus 'arrested in Michigan'. Only the former is relevant to the Divorce event. Unlike events like 'TransportArtifact', where 'place' might refer to a destination or origin, in the Divorce event, 'place' specifically refers to the location of the divorce proceedings or relevant jurisdiction."
