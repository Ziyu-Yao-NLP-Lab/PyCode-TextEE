            "The event is triggered by actions or incidents where one party inflicts harm or damage on another, often involving physical violence or destruction. Example triggers include 'killed', 'raping', 'drugging', 'blast', 'tore', and 'explosion'.",
            "The event is characterized by the presence of an aggressor (attacker) and a recipient of the aggression (victim or target), and may involve the use of instruments or weapons. Unlike a 'Die' event, which focuses on the outcome of death, an 'Attack' event emphasizes the act of aggression itself.",
            "The scope of the event includes any form of physical assault, bombing, shooting, or similar violent actions. It does not include non-violent conflicts or verbal altercations, which are covered under different event types.",
            "Triggers and outcomes for 'Attack' events differ from 'JusticeEvent' types like 'Convict' or 'Sentence', which involve legal proceedings and judgments rather than acts of violence.",
            "Unlike 'MovementEvent' types such as 'Transport', which involve the movement of people or goods, 'Attack' events focus on the act of aggression and its immediate impact on the victims and surroundings."
