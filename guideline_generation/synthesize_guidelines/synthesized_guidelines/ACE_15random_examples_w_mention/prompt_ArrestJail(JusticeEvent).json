            "The event is triggered by the act of detaining or taking someone into custody, typically by law enforcement. Example triggers include 'arrested', 'detained', and 'taken into custody'.",
            "The event involves the physical act of apprehending a person, often in connection with a suspected crime or violation of law. Key characteristics include the involvement of law enforcement agents and the location where the arrest occurs.",
            "Unlike the Convict event, which involves a legal judgment and sentencing, the ArrestJail event focuses on the initial act of taking someone into custody. For example, 'convicted' indicates a legal decision, whereas 'arrested' indicates the act of detaining.",
            "Triggers such as 'arrested' and 'detained' are indicative of the ArrestJail event type, not the ReleaseParole event type, which involves the release of a person from custody.",
            "The event outcomes typically include the person being taken to a police station or jail, but it does not include the legal proceedings that follow, which are covered by other event types like Convict or Trial."

            "Triggers must clearly indicate the act of taking someone into custody. For instance, 'arrested' in 'Police arrested her' is a valid trigger.",
            "Edge cases include phrases like 'held for questioning', which may imply detention but not necessarily an arrest. These should be carefully evaluated.",
            "Triggers such as 'convicted' or 'sentenced' are not valid for this event type as they pertain to legal judgments, not the act of arrest.",
            "In cases where multiple potential triggers are present, the one most directly indicating the act of arrest should be chosen. For example, in 'Police arrested and charged him', 'arrested' is the primary trigger."

            "In cases where the agent is implied but not explicitly mentioned, context should be used to infer the agent. For example, 'She was arrested' implies law enforcement as the agent.",
            "Unlike the Convict event, where the agent might be a judge or jury, the agent in ArrestJail is always the entity performing the physical act of arrest.",
