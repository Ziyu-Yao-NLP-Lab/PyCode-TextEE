            "The event is triggered by a legal decision where a defendant is found not guilty of the charges against them. Example triggers include 'acquitted', 'walk free', and 'acquittal'.",
            "The event is characterized by the formal release of a defendant from legal charges, typically by a court or judicial body. Key characteristics include the involvement of a legal adjudicator and a defendant.",
            "Unlike the 'Convict' event, which results in a guilty verdict, the 'Acquit' event results in a not guilty verdict, leading to the defendant's release. For example, 'acquitted' indicates an 'Acquit' event, not a 'Convict' event.",
            "Triggers such as 'acquitted' and 'walk free' are indicative of the 'Acquit' event type, not events like 'Convict' or 'Sentence', which imply a guilty verdict and subsequent punishment.",
            "The outcome of the 'Acquit' event is the defendant's release from legal charges, distinguishing it from events like 'Extradite' or 'ArrestJail', which involve the transfer or detention of individuals."

            "The event trigger 'mention' is the word or phrase that indicates the occurrence of the 'Acquit' event. Examples include 'acquitted', 'walk free', and 'acquittal'.",
            "Valid triggers for the 'Acquit' event include terms that denote a not guilty verdict or release from charges, such as 'acquitted' and 'walk free'.",
            "Edge cases for the 'mention' argument include phrases like 'found not guilty' or 'cleared of charges', which also indicate an 'Acquit' event.",
            "Triggers such as 'convicted' or 'sentenced' are not valid for the 'Acquit' event, as they imply a guilty verdict and punishment.",
            "The 'mention' argument must clearly indicate the defendant's release from legal charges, distinguishing it from related events like 'Convict' or 'Sentence'."

            "Examples are the entity or person responsible for delivering the not guilty verdict. This can include judges, courts, or judicial bodies. For instance, 'court' in 'The court acquitted the defendant'.",
            "The adjudicator plays a crucial role in the 'Acquit' event by making the legal decision to release the defendant. Examples include 'judge', 'jury', and 'supreme court'.",
            "In cases where multiple adjudicators are involved, such as 'judges Piet Streicher and Mohamed Navsa', all relevant entities should be included.",
            "Unlike the 'prosecutor' in a 'TrialHearing' event, the 'adjudicator' in an 'Acquit' event is responsible for the final decision of not guilty.",

            "The defendant is the central figure in the 'Acquit' event, as they are the one being judged and ultimately released. Examples include 'Wouter Basson' and 'character'.",
            "In cases where the defendant is referred to generically, such as 'one defendant', the argument should still be annotated as 'defendant'.",
            "Unlike the 'victim' in an 'Injure' event, the 'defendant' in an 'Acquit' event is the person being judged and released from charges.",
            "The defendant must be the individual or entity that was on trial and found not guilty, distinguishing them from other roles like 'witness' or 'prosecutor'."
