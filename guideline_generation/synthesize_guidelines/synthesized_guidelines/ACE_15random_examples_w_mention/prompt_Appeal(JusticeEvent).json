            "The event is triggered by an individual or group formally requesting a higher court to review and change the decision of a lower court. Example triggers include 'appeal', 'appealed', and 'appeals'.",
            "The event is characterized by the involvement of a judicial body (adjudicator) and a party seeking the review (plaintiff). The scope includes legal contexts where decisions are contested.",
            "Unlike the 'Sue' event, which involves initiating a lawsuit, the 'Appeal' event specifically involves challenging an existing decision. Triggers such as 'lawsuit' are indicative of 'Sue', not 'Appeal'.",
            "The outcome of the 'Appeal' event is a potential review or reversal of a previous decision, whereas events like 'Acquit' or 'Extradite' involve different judicial actions and outcomes.",
            "The event is distinct from 'DeclareBankruptcy' or 'Marry', which involve financial and personal life events respectively, not judicial reviews. Triggers like 'bankruptcy' or 'marry' are not related to 'Appeal'."

            "Variations such as 'filed an appeal' or 'submitted an appeal' are valid triggers. Edge cases like 'considering an appeal' may not be definitive without context.",
            "The mention should be directly related to the act of appealing. Phrases like 'appeal for clemency' are valid, but 'appeal to emotions' is not.",
            "Triggers must be in the context of a legal or judicial setting. 'Appeal' in marketing or general persuasion contexts does not qualify."
