            "The event is triggered by a person beginning a new role or position, often indicated by verbs such as 'took', 'promoted', 'appointed', 'started', 'back at work', 'get', and 'worked'.",
            "The event is characterized by the initiation of a new job, role, or responsibility by an individual, distinguishing it from events like 'EndPosition' which marks the conclusion of a role.",

            "Triggers such as 'renomination' or 'won' are indicative of 'Nominate' or 'Elect' events, not 'StartPosition' events, which focus on the actual start of a role.",
            "The outcome of a 'StartPosition' event is the individual actively taking on new duties or responsibilities, as opposed to 'EndPosition' where the individual ceases to hold a position."
