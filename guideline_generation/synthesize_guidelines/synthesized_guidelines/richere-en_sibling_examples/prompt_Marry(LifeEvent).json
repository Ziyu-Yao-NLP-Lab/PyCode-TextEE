            "The event is triggered by the act of entering into a legally or culturally recognized union between two individuals, typically referred to as marriage. Example triggers include 'married', 'marriage', and 'remarried'.",
            "The event is characterized by the formalization of a relationship between two people, often involving a ceremony and legal documentation. It is a significant life event that marks the beginning of a marital relationship.",
            "Unlike the Divorce event, which signifies the dissolution of a marriage, the Marry event signifies the commencement of a marital union. Triggers such as 'divorce' are indicative of the Divorce event, not the Marry event.",
            "The Marry event can occur in various cultural and legal contexts, and the specifics of the event may vary accordingly. However, the core aspect remains the formal union of two individuals.",
            "The outcomes of the Marry event include the establishment of a legally or socially recognized partnership, often accompanied by changes in legal status, living arrangements, and social roles."

            "In cases where the location is mentioned in a more general sense, such as 'in most places' or 'in their hometown', these should still be annotated as 'place'.",
            "Edge cases include references to locations that are not explicitly named but implied, such as 'at the venue' or 'there'. These should be annotated as 'place' if the context clearly indicates a location related to the marriage event.",
            "The 'place' argument can also include broader geographical references, such as 'country' or 'state', if they are relevant to the marriage event. For example, 'They got married in the United States' would have 'United States' as the 'place' argument."
