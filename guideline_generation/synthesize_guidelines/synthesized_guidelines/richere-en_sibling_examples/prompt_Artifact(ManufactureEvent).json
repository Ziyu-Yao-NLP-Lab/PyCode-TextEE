            "The event is triggered by the creation or construction of a tangible object or structure. Example triggers include 'building', 'makes', 'produce', and 'built'.",
            "The event is characterized by the involvement of an agent who is responsible for the creation, an artifact that is being created, and optionally a place where the creation occurs.",
            "Unlike a PurchaseEvent, which involves the acquisition of an existing item, this event focuses on the process of creating or manufacturing a new item.",
            "Triggers such as 'buy', 'purchase', or 'acquire' are indicative of PurchaseEvent, not this event type. The Artifact event specifically involves the act of making or constructing something.",
            "The outcome of this event is the existence of a new artifact, which did not exist before the event took place. This distinguishes it from events like RepairEvent, where the focus is on fixing an existing item."

            "Unlike the artifact, which is the object being created, the agent is the creator. For instance, in 'The company produced new software', 'company' is the agent, while 'software' is the artifact."

            "In some cases, the place may not be explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the context. For example, 'The factory produced new cars' implies the place is the factory.",
            "The place is important for understanding the geographical context of the event. It helps in identifying where the artifact is being created.",
            "Unlike the agent and artifact, which are the creator and the created object respectively, the place is the location of the creation process. For instance, in 'The district built a planetarium for this school', 'school' is the place where the planetarium is built."
