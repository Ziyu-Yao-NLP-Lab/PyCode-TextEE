            "The event is triggered by the act of formally requesting a higher court to review and change the decision of a lower court. Example triggers include 'appeal', 'appealed', and 'appellate'.",
            "The event is characterized by the involvement of a defendant who seeks to overturn a previous judgment, often involving legal representatives and adjudicators. Key characteristics include the formal process and the legal context.",
            "Unlike the Convict event, which finalizes a judgment, the Appeal event seeks to challenge and potentially reverse a judgment. Triggers such as 'convicted' are indicative of the Convict event, not the Appeal event.",
            "The Appeal event often results in a higher court's review of the case, which can lead to various outcomes such as upholding, reversing, or modifying the original decision. This differs from the Acquit event, where the defendant is declared not guilty.",
            "Triggers and outcomes for the Appeal event differ from the Sentence event, where the focus is on the punishment given. In the Appeal event, the focus is on challenging the validity of the previous judgment rather than the punishment itself."

            "In some cases, the defendant may be represented by legal counsel or another representative. For example, 'an appeal was made to the Supreme court by a representative of the Justice Department'.",
            "The defendant is distinct from the adjudicator and prosecutor, as they are the party challenging the decision rather than making or defending it.",
