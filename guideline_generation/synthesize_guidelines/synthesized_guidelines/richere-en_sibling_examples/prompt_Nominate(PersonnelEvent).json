        "description": [
            "The event is triggered by the act of officially suggesting or appointing someone for a position or role. Example triggers include 'nominate', 'nominated', 'nomination', 'appoint', and 'renomination'.",
            "The event is characterized by the involvement of an agent who proposes or supports the nomination, a person who is being nominated, and sometimes a place where the nomination occurs. For instance, 'The party nominated John for the position' involves the agent (party) and the person (John).",
            "Unlike the 'Elect' event, which involves the final selection of a candidate through voting, the 'Nominate' event focuses on the proposal or recommendation stage. For example, 'nominated' indicates a proposal, whereas 'elected' indicates a final decision.",
            "Triggers such as 'won' or 'elected' are indicative of the 'Elect' event type, not the 'Nominate' event type. The 'Nominate' event does not imply the final selection but rather the suggestion or recommendation for a role.",
            "The outcome of the 'Nominate' event is the proposal of a candidate for a position, which may or may not lead to their final selection. This is different from the 'StartPosition' event, which indicates the beginning of a role or job."
