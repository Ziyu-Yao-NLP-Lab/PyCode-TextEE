            "The event is triggered by actions involving the transfer of goods, services, or money from one party to another. Example triggers include 'owes', 'mugged', 'seized', 'sold', 'take', 'handing out', and 'compensation'.",
            "The event is characterized by the involvement of at least two parties: a giver and a recipient, and sometimes a beneficiary. The place where the transaction occurs can also be relevant.",
            "Unlike Contact events, which involve communication or interaction between entities, Transaction events specifically involve the transfer or exchange of tangible or intangible assets.",
            "Triggers such as 'stated' are indicative of Contact events, not Transaction events, as they involve communication rather than the transfer of assets.",
            "The outcomes of Transaction events typically involve a change in ownership or possession of assets, whereas similar events like Contact do not result in such changes."

            "Unlike the recipient, the giver is the source of the asset being transferred.",

            "In negative transactions, such as a mugging, the recipient might be the criminal who takes the possessions from the victim."
