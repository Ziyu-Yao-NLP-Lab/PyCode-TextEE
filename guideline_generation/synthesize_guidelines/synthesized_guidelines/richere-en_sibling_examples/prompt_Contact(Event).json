            "Triggers such as 'stated', 'say', 'claimed', and 'conversation' indicate a Contact event, where the primary outcome is the dissemination or reception of information.",
            "The event can occur in various contexts, including formal statements, casual conversations, and directives. The key outcome is the communication itself, not the transfer of physical items or services."
