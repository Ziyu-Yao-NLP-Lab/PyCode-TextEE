            "The event is triggered by the termination or cessation of an organization\u2019s operations. Example triggers include 'closed', 'belly-up', 'abolished', 'under', 'out', 'closing', 'collapse', and 'failure'.",
            "The event is characterized by the end of an organization's existence or its operational activities. This can include businesses, schools, political parties, and other entities.",
            "Unlike the MergeOrg event, which involves the combination of two or more organizations, the EndOrg event signifies the complete cessation of an organization's activities.",
            "Triggers such as 'merge' are indicative of the MergeOrg event type, not the EndOrg event type. Similarly, 'open' is indicative of the StartOrg event type, not the EndOrg event type.",
            "The outcomes of the EndOrg event include the organization no longer functioning or existing, which is different from events like DeclareBankruptcy where the organization may still exist but is undergoing financial restructuring."

            "The 'org' argument is crucial as it specifies the entity that is ceasing operations. It can refer to various types of organizations such as businesses, schools, political parties, etc.",

            "In the context of the EndOrg event, 'place' represents the location affected by the termination. For instance, 'mall' in 'the local Glock dealer would not open up a store in the same strip mall' indicates the location related to the event.",
            "Unlike the 'place' argument in StartOrg events, which indicates where an organization is starting, the 'place' argument in EndOrg events indicates where an organization is ending.",
