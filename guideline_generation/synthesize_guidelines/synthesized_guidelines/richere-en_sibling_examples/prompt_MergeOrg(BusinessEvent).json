            "The event is triggered by the merging of two or more organizations into a single entity. Example triggers include 'merge', 'merged', and 'merger'.",
            "The event is characterized by the combination of separate organizations, often resulting in a new or larger organization. This can involve companies, schools, airlines, or other entities.",
            "Unlike the DeclareBankruptcy event, which involves an organization ceasing operations due to financial insolvency, the MergeOrg event involves the unification of organizations to continue operations together.",
            "Triggers such as 'bankruptcy' or 'closed' are indicative of DeclareBankruptcy or EndOrg events, not the MergeOrg event type.",
            "The outcome of a MergeOrg event is the formation of a single, unified organization from previously separate entities, which is distinct from the StartOrg event where a new organization is created from scratch."

            "Examples are 'ABN Amro' in the context of a merger with another organization. The 'org' argument represents the entities involved in the merging process.",
            "The 'org' argument is crucial as it identifies the specific organizations that are being combined. For instance, 'Southwest High' and 'schools' in the context of school mergers.",
            "In the case of airline mergers, 'org' could include entities like 'American Airlines' and 'US Airways'. This argument helps in understanding the scope and impact of the merger.",
            "Edge cases include scenarios where multiple organizations are mentioned, such as 'Delta Air Lines', 'Northwest Airlines', 'United', and 'Continental'. Each organization involved in the merger should be captured.",
            "Unlike other event types, the 'org' argument in MergeOrg specifically refers to the entities being unified, not those being dissolved or newly created. For example, 'airlines' in the context of a merger event."
