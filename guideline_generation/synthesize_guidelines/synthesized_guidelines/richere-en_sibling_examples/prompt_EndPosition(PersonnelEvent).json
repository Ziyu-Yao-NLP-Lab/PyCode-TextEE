            "The event is characterized by the end of an employment or position held by an individual, often marked by specific actions or decisions leading to the cessation. For instance, 'retirement' and 'firing' are common triggers.",
            "Unlike the StartPosition event, which marks the beginning of a role or job, the EndPosition event signifies the conclusion of such roles. Triggers such as 'hired' or 'appointed' are indicative of StartPosition, not EndPosition.",
            "The event encompasses various scenarios where an individual ceases to hold a position, whether voluntarily (e.g., 'resigned') or involuntarily (e.g., 'terminated').",
            "The outcome of this event is the individual no longer holding the specified position or job. This differs from events like Nominate, which involve the selection or proposal of a candidate for a position."
