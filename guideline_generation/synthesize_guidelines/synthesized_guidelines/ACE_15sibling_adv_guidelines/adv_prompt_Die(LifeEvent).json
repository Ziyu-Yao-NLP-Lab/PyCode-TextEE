    "Die(LifeEvent)": {
        "description": "The 'Die' event type is triggered by the occurrence of a death, indicated by terms such as 'suicide', 'fallen', 'killed', 'death', 'deaths', or 'dead'. This event signifies the end of life of one or more individuals, often involving specific circumstances or causes. It is distinct from related events like 'Injure' or 'Marry', as it specifically denotes the cessation of life. The outcome of this event is the confirmation of death, which can result from various means such as violence, accidents, or natural causes.",
        "attributes": {
            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "agent": "The agent is the entity responsible for causing the death, such as 'bomber' in 'A suicide bomber detonated explosives'. It is crucial for understanding the cause or perpetrator of the death event. In cases of accidents, the agent might be an inanimate object or natural force, e.g., 'earthquake' or 'fire'. Unlike the 'victim', the agent initiates the action leading to death and might be implicit in some contexts, such as 'disease' in 'He died of cancer'.",
            "instrument": "The instrument refers to the means or tools used to cause the death, such as 'explosives' in 'A suicide bomber detonated explosives'. It provides insight into the method of death, which can be critical for understanding the event. In cases of natural death, the instrument might be a condition or disease, e.g., 'cancer' or 'heart attack'. Unlike the 'agent', the instrument is the tool or method used by the agent to cause death and might be abstract in some scenarios, such as 'poison' in 'He was poisoned'.",
            "person": "The person argument identifies the individuals directly involved in the event, such as 'comrades' in 'bodies of fallen comrades'. It is important for identifying who is affected by the death event. The person might be a group or collective, e.g., 'soldiers' or 'civilians', and might not always be the one who dies but could be related to the event. In certain contexts, the person might be indirectly involved, such as 'family members' in 'He left behind a grieving family'.",
            "place": "The place refers to the locations where the death occurs, such as 'mall' in 'A suicide bomber detonated explosives at the entrance to a crowded mall'. It provides context and setting for the death event, which can be crucial for situational understanding. The place might be a broader region, e.g., 'city' or 'country', and is the physical location where the event transpires. In certain scenarios, the place might be implicit, such as 'home' in 'He died peacefully at home'.",
            "victim": "The victim is the individual who dies as a result of the event, such as 'bomber' in 'killing at least four shoppers and wounding 20'. The victim is central to the event as they experience the cessation of life. The victim might be a group or collective, e.g., 'people' or 'civilians', and unlike the 'agent', the victim suffers the consequence of the death event. In certain contexts, the victim might be indirectly referenced, such as 'someone' in 'We are talking about someone's life or death'."
