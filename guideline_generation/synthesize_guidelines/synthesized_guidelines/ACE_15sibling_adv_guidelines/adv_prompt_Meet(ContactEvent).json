It encompasses formal and informal gatherings such as diplomatic talks, business meetings, press conferences, and forums, but excludes casual or unplanned encounters. Typical triggers include terms like 'talks', 'conference', 'forum', 'negotiations', 'meeting', 'brief', and 'discussed'. The outcomes often involve discussions, decisions, or agreements made during the interaction.",
