    "Sue(JusticeEvent)": {
        "description": "The 'Sue' event in the context of justice is triggered by legal actions where a plaintiff initiates a lawsuit against a defendant. This event is characterized by the formal process of bringing a legal case to court, typically involving the pursuit of a legal remedy or compensation. Unlike other justice events such as 'Appeal' or 'Sentence', the 'Sue' event specifically involves the commencement of legal proceedings. Triggers for this event include terms like 'lawsuit', 'sued', 'litigation', 'action', and 'claims'. The outcome of a 'Sue' event is the initiation of a legal case, which may lead to further legal processes such as trials, settlements, or judgments, but does not encompass the final judgment or sentencing.",

            "adjudicator": "The adjudicator is the entity responsible for overseeing and making decisions in the legal case, such as courts, judges, or juries. They play a crucial role in ensuring the legal process is followed and in delivering a verdict or judgment. The adjudicator is neutral and does not have a vested interest in the outcome of the case. In some instances, the adjudicator may not be explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the context.",
            "defendant": "The defendant is the party against whom the lawsuit is filed, such as individuals, organizations, or government entities. They are typically accused of wrongdoing or liability and must respond to the plaintiff's claims. The defendant must defend against the legal action and may face penalties or obligations if found liable. In some cases, the defendant may not be explicitly named but can be inferred from the context.",
            "place": "The place refers to the location where the legal action is filed or takes place, such as specific courts, cities, or broader regions or countries. The place is important as it determines the jurisdiction and legal framework under which the case is adjudicated. It provides geographical context for the legal proceedings and may sometimes be inferred from the context if not explicitly mentioned.",
            "plaintiff": "The plaintiff is the party that initiates the lawsuit and seeks legal remedy or compensation, such as individuals, groups of people, or organizations. They claim to have been wronged or harmed and seek redress through the legal system. The plaintiff must provide evidence to support their claims. In some cases, the plaintiff may not be explicitly named but can be inferred from the context."
