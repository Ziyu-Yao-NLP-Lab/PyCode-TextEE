    "Marry(LifeEvent)": {
        "description": "The Marry event is triggered by the act of entering into a marriage or wedding ceremony, characterized by the formal union of two individuals in a recognized relationship, typically involving a ceremony. It encompasses both the act of getting married and the state of being married, and is distinct from the Divorce event, which signifies the dissolution of a marriage. The Marry event can occur in various contexts, including traditional ceremonies, legal unions, and informal commitments, and is not limited to any specific cultural or religious practices. The outcomes of the Marry event include the establishment of a legally or socially recognized partnership, distinguishing it from other LifeEvents such as BeBorn or Die, which mark the beginning and end of life, respectively. Example triggers include 'marry', 'marriage', 'wedding', 'married', and 'wed'.",

            "person": "The 'person' argument identifies the individuals involved in the marriage. It can refer to one or both individuals getting married and includes proper names, pronouns, and roles or relationships such as 'daughter' or 'companion'. Examples include 'daughter', 'Raja Ahmad Sharir Iskandar', 'their', 'whom', 'she', 'Stewart', 'Alana Hamilton', 'Welch', 'Welches', 'Rudolph Giuliani', and 'companion'. In cases where multiple people are mentioned, such as 'Stewart and Alana Hamilton', both names should be annotated as 'person'.",
            "place": "The 'place' argument identifies the location where the marriage or wedding ceremony takes place, providing context about the setting of the event. It can refer to specific venues, cities, or countries, and includes both formal venues like 'church' or 'court' and informal settings like 'home' or 'beach'. Examples include 'home' and 'Gracie Mansion'. In cases where the location is implied but not explicitly stated, such as 'at her parents' house', the implied location should be annotated as 'place'. Edge cases include references to locations that are part of a larger event, such as 'wedding in Paris', where 'Paris' should be annotated as 'place'."
