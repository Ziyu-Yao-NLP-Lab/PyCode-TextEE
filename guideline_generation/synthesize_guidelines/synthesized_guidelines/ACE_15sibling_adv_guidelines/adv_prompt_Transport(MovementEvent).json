    "Transport(MovementEvent)": {
        "description": "The Transport event, a subtype of MovementEvent, is triggered by verbs or phrases indicating the movement of entities from one place to another, such as 'transport', 'drive', 'fly', 'bring', 'head', 'parachute', and 'cart'. This event involves an agent or vehicle facilitating the movement and an artifact or victim being moved, typically with a clear origin and destination. Unlike other MovementEvent types, the Transport event specifically focuses on the conveyance of entities, often emphasizing the means or method of transportation. Triggers like 'walk', 'run', or 'swim' indicate other MovementEvent types, not Transport. The outcome of a Transport event is the successful relocation of the artifact or victim to a new place, facilitated by an agent or vehicle.",
        "attributes": {
            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "agent": "The agent is the entity responsible for facilitating the transport, such as 'forces', 'medical teams', 'parents', or organizations like 'US forces' or 'police'. The agent initiates and manages the transport process and is distinct from the artifact or victim being transported. In some cases, the agent may be implied but not explicitly mentioned.",
            "artifact": "The artifact is the entity being transported, such as 'women', 'children', 'victims', 'protesters', or individuals like 'Liana Owen'. The artifact is the primary focus of the transport event, being moved from one location to another. Artifacts can be individuals, groups, or objects and do not facilitate the transport but are the subject of the movement. Edge cases include collective groups like 'troops' or 'protesters'.",
            "destination": "The destination is the endpoint of the transport, such as 'Sudan', 'Iraq', 'Manhattan', 'home', or 'airfield'. It defines the scope and goal of the transport event, indicating where the artifact or victim is intended to arrive. Unlike the origin, the destination is the final point in the transport process. It may be implied but not explicitly mentioned in some scenarios.",
            "origin": "The origin is the starting point of the transport, such as 'Sudan', 'Pennsylvania', or 'Fort Hood'. It provides context for where the transport begins, indicating the location from which the artifact or victim is moved. Unlike the destination, the origin is the initial point in the transport process and may be implied but not explicitly mentioned in some scenarios.",
            "place": "The place is a general location associated with the transport event, such as 'Iraq'. It provides additional context, often indicating a broader area involved in the event. Unlike the origin or destination, the place may not specify a start or end point but helps situate the event geographically. Edge cases include large regions or countries like 'across the United States and Canada'.",
            "vehicle": "The vehicle is the means of transportation used in the event, such as 'trains', cars, planes, or ships. It is crucial for understanding how the transport is facilitated, serving as the tool or method used for the transport, not the entity facilitating it. The vehicle may be implied but not explicitly mentioned in some scenarios.",
            "victim": "The victim is the entity being transported, often in a context of harm or distress, such as 'who' or 'victims'. Victims are a specific type of artifact, typically involving individuals in need of assistance or rescue, often highlighted in emergency or medical transport contexts. Unlike general artifacts, victims are usually associated with negative or urgent circumstances. Edge cases include larger groups like 'dozens of wounded victims'."
