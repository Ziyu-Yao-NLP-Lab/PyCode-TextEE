    "Execute(JusticeEvent)": {
        "description": "The 'Execute' event in the justice system is triggered by the act of carrying out a death sentence on an individual, typically by a state or legal authority. This event is characterized by the finality of the action, resulting in the individual's death as a consequence of a legal decision. It is distinct from other justice events like 'Sentence' or 'Convict', which do not necessarily result in death, and from 'ArrestJail' or 'Pardon', which involve different judicial outcomes. Common triggers include terms such as 'executed', 'execution', 'put to death', and 'death'. The event often involves specific arguments such as the 'agent' (the entity carrying out the execution), the 'person' (the individual being executed), and the 'place' (the location where the execution occurs).",
        "attributes": {
            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event, typically words like 'executed', 'execution', 'put to death', and 'death'.",
            "agent": "The 'agent' is the entity responsible for carrying out the execution, which can be a state, country, or specific group. Examples include 'texas', 'Indonesia', 'we', and 'Pakistan'. The 'agent' signifies the authority or body enforcing the death sentence, such as 'Indonesia' in 'Indonesia will delay the execution'. It can also be a collective or unspecified group, like 'we' in 'If we execute them now', or a legal/governmental body, such as 'the attorney general's office'. In some cases, the 'agent' is implied rather than explicitly stated, as in 'Blasphemy is punishable by death under the Pakistan Penal Code', where 'Pakistan' is the implied agent.",
            "person": "The 'person' is the individual who is being executed. Examples include 'person', 'convicts', 'them', 'six', 'men', 'convict', 'McVeigh', 'delma banks', 'he', and 'killer'. The 'person' is central to the event, as they are the subject of the execution, such as 'McVeigh' in 'McVeigh was executed in 2001'. The 'person' may be referred to collectively, like 'six' in 'President Megawati Sukarnoputri has refused clemency for the six', or by their role/status, such as 'convicts' or 'killer'. Edge cases include indirect references, like 'he'd be the 11th killer put to death in texas this year', where 'he' and 'killer' both refer to the person being executed.",
            "place": "The 'place' is the location where the execution takes place. Examples include 'state', 'Indonesia', 'country', and 'texas'. The 'place' provides geographical context, indicating where the execution is carried out, such as 'in texas' in 'lawyers in texas are trying to keep their client from becoming the 300th person executed in the state'. It may also refer to a broader region or country, like 'Indonesia' in 'Use of the death penalty is rare in Indonesia'. The 'place' can be a specific facility or area within a larger region, though this is less common. Edge cases include implied locations, such as 'no blasphemy convict has ever been executed in the country', where 'country' refers to the broader national context."
