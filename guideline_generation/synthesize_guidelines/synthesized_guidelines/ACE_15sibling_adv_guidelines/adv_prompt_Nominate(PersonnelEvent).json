        "description": "The 'Nominate' event type is triggered by the act of officially naming or designating someone for a position or role. This event involves an agent who performs the nomination and a person who is being nominated. It encompasses both formal and informal contexts where a person is proposed for a role. Unlike the 'Elect' event type, which involves a voting process, the 'Nominate' event focuses on the proposal or recommendation stage and does not guarantee that the person will assume the role. Example triggers include 'name', 'nominate', 'designate', and 'select'. Triggers such as 'elected' or 'appointed' are indicative of other event types like 'Elect' or 'StartPosition'. The outcome of the 'Nominate' event is the identification of a candidate for a position, but it does not ensure the final selection or election of the person.",

            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "agent": "The agent is the entity or individual who performs the act of nomination. This can be an individual or an organization, such as 'the pope' in 'the pope will reportedly name a new head', or 'British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown' in 'Gordon Brown on Tuesday named the current head'. The agent indicates the authority or source behind the nomination and can sometimes be implied from context, such as 'you' in 'who you would name?'. Edge cases include scenarios where the agent is not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred, such as 'Peterson, of course, is a candidate for the Lt. Governor nomination' where the nominating entity is implied.",
            "person": "The person is the individual who is being nominated for a position or role. Examples include 'head' in 'name a new head of the troubled Boston archdiocese', and 'candidate' in 'Peterson, of course, is a candidate for the Lt. Governor nomination'. The person can also be a group or collective entity, such as 'board' in 'nominating his own board'. In some contexts, the person can be referred to indirectly, such as 'who' in 'who you would name?'. Edge cases include scenarios where the person is not explicitly named but is understood from context, such as 'members' in 'selecting new Cabinet members'."
