    "EndOrg(BusinessEvent)": {
        "description": "The EndOrg (BusinessEvent) event is triggered by the termination or dissolution of an organization, marking the end of its existence or functional operations. This can include political regimes, companies, or other formal groups. Example triggers include phrases like 'is no more', 'dissolving', 'dismantling', 'crumbled', 'collapsed', and 'is over'. Unlike the StartOrg event, which signifies the beginning of an organization, the EndOrg event specifically involves the conclusion of an organization's activities, often leading to significant changes in the related social, political, or economic landscape. Triggers such as 'merging' or 'opening' are indicative of other event types like MergeOrg or StartOrg and should not be confused with EndOrg events.",

            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "org": "The 'org' argument identifies the organization that is ending. This can include political parties, regimes, companies, or other formal groups. Examples include 'regime', 'party', 'empire', 'regime', and 'Baath Party'. The 'org' argument is crucial as it specifies the entity whose operations or existence are ceasing, helping to pinpoint the exact organization affected by the event. For instance, 'Saddam Hussein's regime' in the example 'is no more'. It distinguishes the specific organization from other entities mentioned in the text, such as 'Baath Party' in 'dissolving the Baath Party'. Edge cases include scenarios where the organization is part of a larger entity, like 'empire' in 'dismantling its entertainment empire'.",
            "place": "The 'place' argument identifies the location where the organization is ending, providing geographical context to the EndOrg event. This can help in understanding the regional impact of the organization's dissolution. Examples include 'Iraq'. The 'place' argument specifies where the event is taking place, such as 'Iraq' in the example 'is no more'. It can distinguish between different locations mentioned in the text, like the implied location in 'the regime collapsed'. Edge cases include scenarios where the location is implied rather than explicitly stated."
