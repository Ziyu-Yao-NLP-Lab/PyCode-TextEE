    "EndPosition(PersonnelEvent)": {
        "description": "The EndPosition(PersonnelEvent) is triggered by the termination or conclusion of a person's role or position within an organization or entity. This event is characterized by explicit language indicating the end of tenure, such as 'quit', 'ending', 'removal', 'leave', 'steps down', 'formerly', and 'previously'. It encompasses voluntary resignation, retirement, or removal from the position. Unlike the StartPosition event, which marks the beginning of a role, the EndPosition event specifically denotes the conclusion of a role, resulting in a vacancy that may or may not be immediately filled. This event does not cover the nomination or election of a successor, which are separate event types.",
        "attributes": {
            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "entity": "The entity argument refers to the organization, company, or institution from which the person is departing. Examples include 'Vivendi Universal Entertainment', 'Department of Trade and Industry', and 'Barclays Bank'. It provides context to the position being vacated and helps identify the scope and impact of the departure within a specific organizational framework. In cases where multiple entities are mentioned, all relevant entities should be included. The entity argument is distinct from the place argument, which refers to the geographical location. Edge cases include scenarios where the entity is implied but not explicitly stated; infer the entity from the context if possible, but ensure clarity and avoid assumptions without sufficient evidence.",
            "person": "The person argument identifies the individual whose position is ending, such as 'Barry Diller', 'Jean-Marie Messier', or 'Callum McCarthy'. It specifies the subject of the event, providing a clear focus on who is leaving the position. In cases where pronouns are used, ensure that the antecedent is clear and correctly identified to avoid ambiguity. The person argument should not be confused with the agent in related events like Nominate or Elect, where the focus is on the individual initiating the action rather than the one affected by it. Edge cases include scenarios where multiple individuals are mentioned; ensure that the person argument accurately reflects the individual whose position is ending.",
            "place": "The place argument refers to the geographical location associated with the end of the position, such as 'Chinese' or 'London'. It provides additional context, indicating where the event is taking place or where the organization/entity is based. In cases where the place is not explicitly mentioned, infer it from the context if possible, but ensure clarity and avoid assumptions without sufficient evidence. The place argument is distinct from the entity argument, which refers to the organization or institution. Edge cases include scenarios where the place is implied through cultural or regional references; ensure that the place argument accurately reflects the geographical context relevant to the event."
