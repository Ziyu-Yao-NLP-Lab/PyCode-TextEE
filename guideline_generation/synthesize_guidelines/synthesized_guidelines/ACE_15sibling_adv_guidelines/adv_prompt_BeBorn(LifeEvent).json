    "BeBorn(LifeEvent)": {
        "description": "The BeBorn event, a type of LifeEvent, is triggered by the birth or emergence of a person, typically indicated by terms such as 'born', 'birth', 'gave birth', 'removed', 'cut out', or 'having'. This event marks the introduction of a new individual into the world, often specifying the person being born and sometimes the place of birth. It is distinct from other LifeEvents like 'Die' or 'Marry', which focus on the end of life or significant life changes, respectively. The outcome of the BeBorn event is the existence of a new person, differentiating it from events like 'Die' where the outcome is the end of a life, or 'Marry' where the outcome is a change in marital status.",
        "attributes": {
            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "person": "This argument identifies the individual who is being born, with examples including 'babies', 'one', 'other', 'infant', 'Hunter', 'girl', 'baby', 'that', 'child', 'girls', 'boys'. It specifies the new individual introduced by the event, which can refer to a specific person or a general term like 'baby' or 'child'. In cases where multiple individuals are born, each is considered a separate instance of the 'person' argument. Unlike the 'victim' argument in the 'Die' event, the 'person' argument in the BeBorn event refers to the new life. Edge cases include references to unborn individuals, such as 'fetus' or 'that', which still fall under the 'person' argument as they denote the entity being born.",
            "place": "This argument identifies the location where the birth takes place, with examples including 'home', 'New Zealand', 'nation'. The 'place' argument provides context to the event, indicating where the birth occurred. While it may sometimes be implicit or not explicitly mentioned, when present, it adds significant detail to the event. Unlike the 'place' argument in the 'Die' event, which indicates where a death occurred, the 'place' argument in the BeBorn event specifies the location of birth. Edge cases include broad or non-specific locations like 'nation', which still qualify as the 'place' argument as they provide a general context for the birth."
