    "TrialHearing(JusticeEvent)": {
        "description": "The TrialHearing event, a type of JusticeEvent, is triggered by legal proceedings where a case is being heard or tried in a court of law. This event involves an adjudicator, a defendant, and often a prosecutor, and takes place in a specific location such as a court or city. Unlike related events such as 'Appeal' or 'Sentence', this event focuses on the process of hearing or trying a case rather than the outcome or subsequent legal actions. The outcome of this event is not the final judgment or sentence but the process of presenting evidence, arguments, and legal proceedings in front of an adjudicator. Example triggers include 'hearing', 'trial', 'case', and 'tried'.",

            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "adjudicator": "The adjudicator, such as a judge, court, or jury, is the authority presiding over the trial or hearing, responsible for making legal decisions. This role is crucial for ensuring the trial or hearing is conducted fairly and according to the law. Examples include 'judge' in 'an oklahoma city judge has ruled' and 'Supreme Court'. Unlike the prosecutor or defendant, the adjudicator is neutral and does not represent either party. In some cases, the adjudicator may not be explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the context, such as 'the court said'.",
            "defendant": "The defendant is the individual or entity being tried or heard in the legal proceedings, such as 'nichols', 'Anwar Ibrahim', or 'Markovic'. The defendant's role is to respond to the charges or claims brought against them. There may be multiple defendants in some cases, such as 'officials' in 'Markovic will be tried along with 10 other Milosevic-era officials'. Unlike the prosecutor, the defendant is the party accused or charged in the trial or hearing. The defendant may not always be explicitly named but can be inferred from the context, such as 'the wife' in 'Milosevic's wife will go on trial'.",
            "place": "The place is the location where the trial or hearing is taking place, such as 'oklahoma city', 'Belgrade', or 'New York'. It provides context for the jurisdiction and legal authority overseeing the trial or hearing. Examples include 'oklahoma city' in 'an oklahoma city judge has ruled' and 'Belgrade district court'. Unlike the adjudicator or defendant, the place is a geographical location and not a person or entity involved in the trial or hearing. The place may not always be explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the context, such as 'the court' in 'the court said'.",
            "prosecutor": "The prosecutor is the individual or entity presenting the case against the defendant in the trial or hearing, such as 'prosecutors', 'lawyer', or 'prosecution'. The prosecutor's role is to provide evidence and arguments to prove the defendant's guilt or liability. Examples include 'prosecutors' in 'prosecutors presented enough evidence' and 'lawyer'. Unlike the defendant, the prosecutor represents the state or the party bringing the charges or claims in the trial or hearing. The prosecutor may not always be explicitly named but can be inferred from the context, such as 'the prosecution' in 'following an agreement with the prosecution'."
