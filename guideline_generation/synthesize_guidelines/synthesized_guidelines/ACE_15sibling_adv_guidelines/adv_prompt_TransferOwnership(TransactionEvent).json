    "TransferOwnership(TransactionEvent)": {
        "description": "The TransferOwnership event is triggered by the transfer of ownership of an artifact from one entity to another. This event involves a change in possession or control of an artifact, which can be physical or intellectual property, and is typically characterized by the involvement of a seller and a buyer. The scope of this event includes any transaction where an artifact is transferred, regardless of the medium or context, such as selling a business or acquiring a property. Triggers for this event include terms like 'sell', 'buy', 'acquire', 'provide', 'donate', and 'gift'. The primary outcome of this event is the change in ownership of the artifact, distinguishing it from events like TransferMoney, which focus on the transfer of funds.",
        "attributes": {
            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "artifact": "The artifact is the item or entity being transferred in the event. Examples include 'apartment', 'operations', 'hotel', 'property', 'business', 'parks', and 'division'. It can be tangible, like 'property', or intangible, like 'operations'. In specific contexts, the artifact could be specialized, such as 'nuclear weapons' in a geopolitical scenario or 'shares' in a financial transaction. Edge cases include scenarios where the artifact is implied rather than explicitly mentioned, such as 'selling everything'. Unlike TransferMoney, which focuses on the amount, TransferOwnership focuses on the specific item or entity being transferred.",
            "beneficiary": "The beneficiary is the entity that benefits from the transfer, often receiving the artifact. Examples include 'nanny'. The beneficiary can be an individual or an organization and is important as it identifies who gains from the transaction. In some cases, the beneficiary might not be directly involved in the transaction but still receives the benefits, such as 'a charity' receiving a donated artifact. Edge cases include scenarios where the beneficiary is a group or community, such as 'residents' benefiting from a transferred public asset. Unlike the buyer, the beneficiary does not necessarily provide compensation for the artifact; they simply receive the benefits.",
            "buyer": "The buyer is the entity that acquires the artifact in exchange for compensation. Examples include 'company', 'Andrew Harris', 'firm', and 'Blackstone Group'. The buyer is essential as it represents the party gaining ownership of the artifact, often providing monetary or other forms of compensation. In specific contexts, the buyer could be a corporate entity, an individual, or a government body, depending on the nature of the transaction. Edge cases include scenarios where the buyer is a consortium or partnership, such as 'a group of investors' acquiring a business. Unlike the beneficiary, the buyer is actively involved in the transaction and provides compensation for the artifact.",
            "place": "The place is the location where the transfer of ownership occurs or where the artifact is situated. Examples include 'Belgrade'. The place is significant as it provides context to the transaction, indicating where the transfer is taking place or where the artifact is located. In specific contexts, the place could be a specific address, a city, or even a virtual location in the case of digital assets. Edge cases include scenarios where the place is not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the context, such as 'the headquarters' implying the company's main office. Unlike the artifact, which is the item being transferred, the place provides the geographical or situational context of the transfer.",
            "seller": "The seller is the entity that transfers ownership of the artifact in exchange for compensation. Examples include 'Mirjana Markovic', 'USA Interactive', 'Vivendi', and 'group'. The seller is crucial as it represents the party relinquishing ownership of the artifact, often receiving monetary or other forms of compensation. In specific contexts, the seller could be an individual, a corporation, or a government entity, depending on the nature of the transaction. Edge cases include scenarios where the seller is a consortium or partnership, such as 'a group of shareholders' selling their stakes. Unlike the buyer, the seller is the party that initiates the transfer of ownership and receives compensation for the artifact."
