    "StartOrg(BusinessEvent)": {
        "description": "The StartOrg event is triggered by the establishment or creation of a new organization. This event is characterized by the initiation of a new business entity or organization, often involving an agent responsible for the creation and a specific location where the organization is established. Unlike the MergeOrg event, which involves the combination of existing organizations, the StartOrg event focuses solely on the creation of a new, independent entity. Triggers such as 'founded', 'created', 'launched', 'opened', and 'built' are indicative of this event. The outcome of the StartOrg event is the existence of a new organization, distinct from events like EndOrg, where an organization ceases to exist, or DeclareBankruptcy, where an organization declares financial insolvency.",

            "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
            "agent": "The agent is the individual or entity responsible for initiating the creation of the new organization. This can include individuals, groups, or existing organizations. Examples include 'Kim Dae-Jung' in 'The ruling Millennium Democratic Party (MDP), founded by former president Kim Dae-Jung', 'Daily Planet Ltd' in 'The Daily Planet Ltd, about to become the first brothel to list on the Australian Stock Exchange', and 'AIG' in 'AIG is in the final stage of talks to take over General Electric's Japanese life insurance arm in a deal to create Japan's sixth largest life insurer'. Unlike the org argument, which refers to the new entity being created, the agent refers to the existing entity or individual responsible for the creation.",
            "org": "The org is the new organization that is being created or established. This can include new branches or subsidiaries of existing organizations, as well as conceptual or planned entities. Examples include 'Millennium Democratic Party' in 'The ruling Millennium Democratic Party (MDP), founded by former president Kim Dae-Jung', 'Disneyland' in 'plans to follow up its May Day launching by opening a 'sex Disneyland' here', and 'network' in 'he helped launch the Fox Television network'. Unlike the agent, which refers to the entity responsible for the creation, the org refers to the new entity that is being created.",
            "place": "The place is the location where the new organization is being established. This can include specific venues, broader regions, or countries. Examples include 'here' in 'plans to follow up its May Day launching by opening a 'sex Disneyland' here', 'Sydney' in 'Prostitution is completely decriminalised in Sydney and we are going to build a monster', and 'Japan' in 'AIG is in the final stage of talks to take over General Electric's Japanese life insurance arm in a deal to create Japan's sixth largest life insurer'. Unlike the agent and org arguments, which refer to entities, the place argument provides the spatial context for the StartOrg event."
