            "The event is triggered by the occurrence of a death, whether it is a single individual or multiple people. Example triggers include 'killed', 'death', 'fallen', and 'suicide'.",
            "The event is characterized by the cessation of life, often involving a victim and sometimes an agent or instrument. It can occur in various contexts such as accidents, attacks, or natural causes.",
            "Unlike related events such as 'Injure', this event specifically denotes the end of life rather than harm or injury. For instance, 'wounding' indicates an injury event, not a death event.",
            "Triggers such as 'marry' or 'divorce' are indicative of other life events and not related to the 'Die' event type. The 'Die' event is solely focused on the end of life.",
            "The outcome of this event is the death of the person(s) involved, distinguishing it from events like 'BeBorn' which signify the beginning of life. For example, 'birth' is a trigger for 'BeBorn', not 'Die'."
