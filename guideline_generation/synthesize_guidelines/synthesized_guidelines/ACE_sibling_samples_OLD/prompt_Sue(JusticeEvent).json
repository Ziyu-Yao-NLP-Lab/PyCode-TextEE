  "Sue(JusticeEvent)": {
    "description": [
      "The event is triggered by legal actions initiated by one party (plaintiff) against another party (defendant) in a court or similar adjudicating authority. Example triggers include 'sued,' 'lawsuit,' and 'litigation.'",
      "This event involves the formal filing of legal complaints or cases, often requiring the presence of a plaintiff, defendant, and sometimes an adjudicator, alongside the legal context or place of filing.",
      "Unlike other JusticeEvents such as Appeal or Acquit, Sue focuses on the initiation of a legal process rather than a response to a prior ruling or an outcome of a trial.",
      "Triggers like 'filed a case' or 'brought to court' indicate Sue, as opposed to terms like 'appealed' or 'pardoned,' which are related to other JusticeEvent types.",
      "This event captures the dynamic of one party seeking legal remedies or damages against another through formal judicial processes, often tied to specific legal or geographical jurisdictions."

  "attributes": {
    "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
    "adjudicator": [
      "Examples are courts or legal bodies involved in adjudicating the lawsuit, such as 'courts'.",
      "Adjudicators represent the judicial or administrative authority presiding over the legal dispute between the plaintiff and defendant.",
      "This argument is crucial in providing the institutional context within which the lawsuit occurs, differentiating Sue from extrajudicial conflicts.",
      "Unlike plaintiffs or defendants, adjudicators are neutral entities responsible for resolving disputes rather than initiating or defending claims.",
      "In ambiguous scenarios, the adjudicator may be inferred from references to legal proceedings, such as 'judicial system' or specific courts."
    ],
    "defendant": [
      "Examples are individuals or entities against whom the lawsuit is filed, such as 'Iraq' or 'Crichton'.",
      "Defendants are typically mentioned as the party accused or held liable in the legal context of the event.",
      "This argument helps identify the opposing side to the plaintiff in the legal action, a key feature distinguishing Sue from other event types.",
      "Unlike plaintiffs, defendants are reactive participants, often described in the context of allegations or demands made against them.",
      "In cases involving multiple defendants, all identifiable parties should be annotated, providing a comprehensive understanding of the lawsuit."
    ],
    "place": [
      "Examples are geographical locations where the legal action is filed or conducted, such as 'Washington'.",
      "The place argument situates the legal action within a specific jurisdiction, which can impact the legal processes and outcomes.",
      "Unlike adjudicators, the place is not an institution but a physical or geopolitical setting, such as a city, state, or country.",
      "Place adds context to the event, especially when the legal action spans multiple jurisdictions or involves international parties.",
      "Edge cases include references to overarching regions (e.g., 'United States') when a more specific location is unavailable or unclear."
    ],
    "plaintiff": [
      "Examples are individuals or entities initiating the lawsuit, such as 'relatives,' 'survivors', or 'Anne-Marie'.",
      "Plaintiffs are active participants in the event, described as seeking legal remedies, compensation, or justice against the defendant.",
      "This argument distinguishes Sue from events where the roles are reversed, such as Appeal, where the defendant often takes proactive action.",
      "Unlike defendants, plaintiffs are characterized by agency and initiative in the legal process, often described in terms of filing or bringing claims.",
      "In scenarios involving collective plaintiffs, all explicitly mentioned participants should be annotated, reflecting the full scope of the legal action."
