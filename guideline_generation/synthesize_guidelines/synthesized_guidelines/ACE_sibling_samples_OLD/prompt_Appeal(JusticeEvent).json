        "description": [
            "The event is triggered by actions or communications indicating a formal request to a higher authority or court to review and potentially overturn a previous decision, such as 'appealed' or 'appeal'.",
            "The event is characterized by the involvement of a plaintiff who seeks redress and an adjudicator who reviews the appeal, typically in a legal or judicial context.",
            "This event focuses on the procedural act of challenging a prior ruling, contrasting with events like 'Sue', which involve initiating legal action, or 'Execute', which refers to carrying out a legal sentence.",
            "Triggers such as 'appeal' are specific to this event type, whereas terms like 'extradition' indicate a different JusticeEvent type focused on relocating a defendant between jurisdictions.",
            "The outcomes of the event typically involve the higher authority's decision to uphold, overturn, or modify the original ruling, distinguishing it from events like 'Acquit', which involve declaring a defendant not guilty."

        "adjudicator": [
            "Examples are judicial or official bodies such as 'Supreme Court' or 'Court of Appeals' that have the authority to review and make a decision on the appeal.",
            "The adjudicator plays a central role in reviewing the appeal, ensuring that the appeal process is aligned with legal protocols and judicial fairness.",
            "Triggers like 'appeal' directly imply the involvement of an adjudicator, whereas events like 'ArrestJail' may involve an agent such as 'Police' instead.",
            "Edge cases include non-traditional adjudicators, such as arbitration panels, which may function similarly but operate outside formal court systems.",
            "The adjudicator's decision is final within the context of this event, unlike lower courts or non-binding recommendations."

        "place": [
            "Examples are locations such as 'Indonesia' or specific jurisdictions where the appeal is filed or heard.",
            "The place indicates the geographic or legal jurisdiction where the appeal process is conducted, influencing applicable legal frameworks.",
            "This argument differentiates the Appeal event from events like 'Extradite', where place indicates origin and destination jurisdictions.",
            "Places are not limited to physical courts; they may include virtual or digital jurisdictions if the appeal process is conducted online.",
            "Edge cases include appeals filed in one jurisdiction but reviewed in another due to judicial agreements or legal transference."

        "plaintiff": [
            "Examples are individuals or groups such as 'convict', 'five', or 'their' who are initiating the appeal process.",
            "The plaintiff is the party seeking a reversal or modification of a prior decision, essential to the event as the initiator of the appeal.",
            "Unlike events like 'Sue', where the plaintiff initiates new legal action, the plaintiff in Appeal seeks to challenge or review an existing judgment.",
            "In edge cases, a proxy or representative, such as a lawyer, may act on behalf of the plaintiff, though the original appellant remains the actual plaintiff.",
            "Triggers such as 'appealed' imply active participation by the plaintiff, distinguishing it from events where the plaintiff is more passive or reactive."
