        "description": [
            "The event is triggered by the act of transferring a person from one jurisdiction to another for legal proceedings or punishment. Example triggers include 'extradite', 'extradition', and 'extraditing'.",
            "The event is characterized by the involvement of legal authorities and the movement of a person from an origin location to a destination location. It often involves formal agreements or legal processes between different jurisdictions.",
            "Unlike the 'ArrestJail' event, which focuses on the act of taking someone into custody, the 'Extradite' event specifically involves the transfer of a person across jurisdictions for legal reasons.",
            "Triggers such as 'release' or 'pardon' are indicative of events like 'ReleaseParole' or 'Pardon', not the 'Extradite' event type. The 'Extradite' event focuses on the legal transfer process rather than the outcome of freedom or clemency.",
            "The outcome of the 'Extradite' event is the person being moved to a new jurisdiction where they will face legal proceedings or punishment. This differs from events like 'TrialHearing' or 'Convict', which focus on the legal proceedings themselves rather than the transfer process."

            "In some cases, the agent may be a specific legal authority or government body that has the jurisdiction to request or enforce the extradition.",

            "In some cases, the person may be a suspect, defendant, or convicted individual facing legal proceedings or punishment in the destination jurisdiction.",
            "Unlike the 'agent' argument, which refers to the entity facilitating the extradition, the 'person' is the individual being transferred.",
