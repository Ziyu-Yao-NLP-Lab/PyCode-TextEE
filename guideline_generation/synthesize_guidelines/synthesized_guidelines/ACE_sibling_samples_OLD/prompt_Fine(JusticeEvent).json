    "description": [
      "The event is triggered by the imposition of a financial penalty on an individual or entity, typically as a result of a legal or regulatory decision. Examples of triggers include 'fine,' 'fined,' and 'ordered to pay.'",
      "This event captures the action of penalizing an entity monetarily, highlighting the entity being fined, the adjudicator imposing the fine, and optionally, the place where the fine is imposed.",
      "Unlike Sentence, which focuses on assigning penalties like imprisonment, Fine specifically pertains to monetary penalties.",
      "Triggers such as 'fined' or 'pay a fine' distinguish this event from other JusticeEvents like Convict or ArrestJail, which deal with criminal guilt or detention rather than financial penalties.",
      "The event provides details about the adjudicator (authority imposing the fine), the entity penalized, and optionally the location, emphasizing the legal or procedural nature of the fine."

    "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
    "adjudicator": [
      "Examples are the legal or regulatory authorities imposing the fine, such as 'judge' or 'SEC'.",
      "The adjudicator argument identifies the official or institution responsible for deciding and enforcing the fine, emphasizing their authoritative role.",
      "This argument is crucial for distinguishing Fine events from informal or non-legal financial penalties.",
      "Unlike the entity argument, which refers to the penalized party, the adjudicator identifies the enforcing authority.",
      "In cases involving multiple adjudicators, annotate all explicitly mentioned entities involved in the decision to impose the fine."

    "entity": [
      "Examples are individuals or organizations penalized financially, such as 'Ranjha' or 'Monitor'.",
      "The entity argument identifies the party responsible for paying the fine, emphasizing their role as the recipient of the financial penalty.",
      "This argument is central to the Fine event, differentiating it from other JusticeEvents where the focus might be on criminal guilt or legal appeals.",
      "Unlike the adjudicator argument, which identifies the authority imposing the fine, the entity focuses on the penalized individual or organization.",
      "In cases where multiple entities are fined, annotate all explicitly mentioned parties responsible for paying the penalty."
    ],
    "place": [
      "Examples are locations where the fine is imposed or where the penalized party operates, such as 'offices'.",
      "The place argument situates the event within a specific geographical or contextual setting, adding clarity to the legal or procedural context.",
      "Unlike the entity argument, which identifies the fined party, the place provides spatial or jurisdictional information about where the event occurred.",
      "This argument is optional and may not always be explicitly mentioned; however, it should be annotated when present.",
      "In cases involving multiple places, prioritize the one most directly associated with the imposition of the fine or the adjudicator."
