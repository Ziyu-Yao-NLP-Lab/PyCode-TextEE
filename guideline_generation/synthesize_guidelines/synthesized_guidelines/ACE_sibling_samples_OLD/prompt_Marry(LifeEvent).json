    "description": [
      "The event is triggered by an action or state indicating a union or marriage between individuals. Examples of triggers include 'marry,' 'marriage,' and 'wedding.'",
      "This event focuses on the formation of a marital relationship or references to existing or past marriages, highlighting the participants involved.",
      "Unlike Divorce, which focuses on the dissolution of a marital relationship, Marry emphasizes the establishment or continuation of a marriage.",
      "Triggers such as 'wed' and 'marriages' distinguish Marry from related LifeEvents like BeBorn or Die, which focus on different life milestones.",
      "The event captures the participants (persons getting married) and optionally the location (place) where the marriage occurs or is mentioned."

    "person": [
      "Examples are individuals involved in the marriage, such as 'daughter' and 'Raja Ahmad Sharir Iskandar' or 'Rudolph Giuliani' and 'companion'.",
      "The person argument identifies the participants forming the marital relationship, emphasizing their roles as the central figures in the event.",
      "This argument is critical for understanding the primary focus of the Marry event, distinguishing it from related events like Divorce, where the focus is on the separation.",
      "Unlike the place argument, which situates the event geographically, the person argument exclusively identifies individuals entering or involved in the marital relationship.",
      "In cases involving multiple individuals, annotate all explicitly mentioned participants of the marriage."

    "place": [
      "Examples are locations associated with the marriage, such as 'home' or 'Gracie Mansion'.",
      "The place argument situates the event within a specific geographical or ceremonial context, adding clarity to where the marriage occurs or is mentioned.",
      "Unlike the person argument, which focuses on the individuals involved, the place provides spatial or contextual information about the event.",
      "Places are optional and may not always be mentioned; however, they should be annotated when explicitly referenced in the text.",
      "In cases with ambiguous or multiple locations, prioritize the one most directly associated with the event or participants."
