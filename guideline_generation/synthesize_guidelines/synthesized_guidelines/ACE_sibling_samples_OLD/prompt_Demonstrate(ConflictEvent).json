            "The event is triggered by actions or gatherings where people publicly express their opinions, often in opposition to something, such as 'rally', 'march', or 'protest'.",
            "The event is characterized by a collective action where a group of individuals come together to voice their stance on a particular issue, often in a public space.",
            "Unlike an 'Attack' event, which involves physical violence or harm, a 'Demonstrate' event focuses on the act of public expression and assembly, even if it may lead to clashes with authorities.",
            "Triggers such as 'rally' and 'march' are indicative of a 'Demonstrate' event, not an 'Attack' event, which would involve terms like 'assault' or 'killed'.",
            "The outcomes of a 'Demonstrate' event typically involve public visibility and potential arrests, rather than physical harm or destruction, which are outcomes of an 'Attack' event."
