    "description": [
      "The event is triggered by actions or occurrences that result in physical harm or injury to individuals. Examples of triggers include 'wounded,' 'injured,' and 'harm.'",
      "This event focuses on the infliction of harm leading to injuries, highlighting the affected individuals (victims) and optionally the agents, instruments, and places involved.",
      "Unlike Die, which marks the cessation of life, Injure emphasizes non-fatal harm or physical injury sustained by individuals.",
      "Triggers such as 'harm' and 'wounded' indicate Injure events, distinguishing them from related events like BeBorn, which concerns life creation rather than harm.",
      "The event captures details about the victim(s) of the injury, the cause (agent or instrument), and the location where the injury occurred."

  "attributes": {
    "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
    "agent": [
      "Examples are individuals or entities responsible for causing the injury, such as 'bomber'.",
      "The agent argument identifies the initiator of the action leading to the injury, whether intentional or accidental.",
      "This argument is crucial for understanding causality, distinguishing Injure from self-inflicted harm or accidental injuries without an identifiable agent.",
      "Unlike the instrument argument, which refers to the means used, the agent refers to the individual or group performing the action.",
      "In cases where multiple agents are involved, annotate all explicitly mentioned participants responsible for causing the injury."
    ],
    "instrument": [
      "Examples are objects or mechanisms used to inflict the injury, such as 'explosives' or 'guns'.",
      "The instrument argument identifies the means or tools employed in causing the injury, providing details on how harm was inflicted.",
      "This argument adds specificity to the event, distinguishing it from Injure cases caused directly by an agent's physical action without external tools.",
      "Unlike the agent argument, which identifies the actor, the instrument highlights the tool or method used in causing harm.",
      "In cases with multiple instruments, annotate all explicitly mentioned tools contributing to the injury."
    ],
    "place": [
      "Examples are locations where the injury occurred, such as 'mall' or 'airport'.",
      "The place argument situates the event within a geographical or contextual setting, adding clarity to the event's location.",
      "This argument is optional and may not always be explicitly mentioned; however, it should be annotated when present.",
      "Unlike the victim argument, which focuses on the injured individuals, the place provides spatial information about where the event occurred.",
      "In cases where multiple places are mentioned, prioritize the one most directly associated with the injury."
    ],
    "victim": [
      "Examples are individuals or groups who sustain injuries, such as '20' or 'women, children, civilians'.",
      "The victim argument identifies the affected parties, emphasizing those who experience harm during the event.",
      "This argument is central to the Injure event, as it highlights the individuals who bear the consequences of the injury.",
      "Unlike the agent argument, which identifies the cause of the injury, the victim focuses on the recipient of the harm.",
      "In cases involving multiple victims, annotate all explicitly mentioned individuals or groups who were injured."
