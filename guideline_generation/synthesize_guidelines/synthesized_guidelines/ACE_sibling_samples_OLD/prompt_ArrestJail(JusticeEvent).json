            "The event is triggered by actions where an individual or group is taken into custody by law enforcement, such as 'arrested', 'detained', or 'jailed'.",
            "The event is characterized by the involvement of law enforcement agents and the physical act of taking someone into custody, often at a specific location.",
            "Unlike events such as 'Pardon' or 'Acquit', this event involves the initiation of custody rather than the release or exoneration of an individual.",
            "Triggers such as 'arrested' or 'jailed' indicate this event type, whereas triggers like 'pardoned' or 'acquitted' are indicative of different JusticeEvent types.",
            "The outcome of this event is the confinement of the person(s) involved, distinguishing it from events like 'Sue' or 'Appeal', which involve legal proceedings without immediate physical custody."

            "This argument helps in understanding where the justice action is occurring.",
            "For instance, in 'arrested her in Abilene, Texas', 'Abilene' is the place.",
            "Unlike the 'place' in 'Sue' events which might indicate where a lawsuit is filed, here it indicates where the physical act of arrest happens."
