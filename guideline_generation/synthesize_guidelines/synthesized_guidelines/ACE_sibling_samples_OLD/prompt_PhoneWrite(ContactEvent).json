    "description": [
      "The event is triggered by an act of verbal or written communication that occurs through a telephone or similar device. Examples of triggers include 'call,' 'telephone,' and 'told.'",
      "This event captures interactions between individuals or entities facilitated by remote communication technology, focusing on the exchange of information or dialogue.",
      "Unlike events such as Meet, which involve in-person interactions, PhoneWrite specifically focuses on remote communication, often mediated by devices like phones or telecommunication systems.",
      "Triggers such as 'discussed' or 'said by telephone' indicate PhoneWrite, distinguishing it from events like Report, which emphasize the broadcast or dissemination of information to a broader audience.",
      "This event involves at least one communicating entity (e.g., speaker or listener) and optionally a place, which situates the communication within a geographical or contextual setting."
    ]
  },
  "attributes": {
    "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
    "entity": [
      "Examples are individuals or groups involved in the communication, such as 'spokesman', 'Bush' and 'Chretien', or 'leaders'.",
      "The entity argument identifies the participants in the communication, whether as speakers, listeners, or both.",
      "This argument is crucial for understanding the actors engaged in the PhoneWrite event, differentiating their roles from those of third-party observers or facilitators.",
      "Unlike the place argument, which situates the event geographically, entity refers exclusively to the individuals or groups engaging in the communication.",
      "In cases involving multiple entities, annotate all explicitly mentioned participants in the communication."
    ],
    "place": [
      "Examples are locations associated with the communication, such as 'Agartala'.",
      "The place argument provides contextual information about where the communication occurs or is referenced, enhancing the specificity of the event.",
      "Unlike the entity argument, which focuses on the participants, place situates the event within a physical or geopolitical framework.",
      "Places are optional and may not always be present; they should be annotated when explicitly mentioned in the text.",
      "In cases with ambiguous or multiple locations, prioritize the one most directly tied to the context or participants of the communication."
