      "description": [
        "The event is triggered by an action involving the transfer of money from one entity to another. Examples of triggers include 'pay,' 'gives,' and 'payment.'",
        "This event typically involves participants such as the giver, recipient, beneficiary, and possibly the place where the transaction occurs, emphasizing the flow of monetary resources.",
        "Unlike TransferOwnership, which involves the transfer of ownership of artifacts, TransferMoney focuses on the transfer of monetary value without changing ownership of physical or intangible assets.",
        "Triggers such as 'pay' indicate monetary transactions, whereas terms like 'sell' or 'provide' signify events related to ownership transfer or provision of goods/services.",
        "This event explicitly deals with money as the central artifact being transferred, and the arguments capture the participants and context of this financial exchange."

      "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
      "beneficiary": [
        "Examples are individuals or groups who benefit from the transfer of money, such as 'Democrats'.",
        "Beneficiaries are the intended recipients of the advantage or benefit resulting from the financial transaction, even if they do not directly receive the funds.",
        "This argument is critical for understanding the purpose or target of the monetary transfer, such as a charitable organization or specific group.",
        "Unlike recipients, beneficiaries may not directly handle the money but are indirectly impacted or supported by the transfer.",
        "In ambiguous cases, beneficiaries should be identified as those mentioned as the focus or purpose of the transfer, even if not explicitly named as receiving funds."
      ],
      "giver": [
        "Examples are entities initiating the transfer of money, such as 'Planned Parenthood' or 'girls'.",
        "The giver is often explicitly mentioned as the source of the monetary resources being transferred.",
        "Givers can range from individuals to organizations and are identified by terms indicating who provides or pays the money.",
        "Unlike beneficiaries, givers are actively involved in the act of transferring money rather than passively benefiting from it.",
        "Edge cases include scenarios where multiple givers are involved; all should be annotated if clearly identified in the text."
      ],
      "place": [
        "Examples are specific locations associated with the monetary transaction, such as 'Colorado'.",
        "The place argument provides context about where the transaction occurs or is finalized, offering geographical or situational details.",
        "Places are secondary to the transaction but essential for understanding the context, particularly in legal or logistical scenarios.",
        "Unlike givers and recipients, the place does not indicate a participant but rather the environment or jurisdiction of the event.",
        "In cases involving multiple places, prioritize the location most directly tied to the monetary transfer."
      ],
      "recipient": [
        "Examples are individuals or entities directly receiving the money, such as 'neighbor'.",
        "The recipient is the party to whom the money is explicitly transferred during the event, distinct from beneficiaries who may indirectly benefit.",
        "Recipients are often identified by terms such as 'paid to,' 'given to,' or 'transferred to,' indicating direct handling of the funds.",
        "Unlike givers, recipients are passive in the transaction, receiving funds without initiating the transfer.",
        "Edge cases include unclear transactions; the recipient is inferred from context or explicitly identified as the receiving party."
