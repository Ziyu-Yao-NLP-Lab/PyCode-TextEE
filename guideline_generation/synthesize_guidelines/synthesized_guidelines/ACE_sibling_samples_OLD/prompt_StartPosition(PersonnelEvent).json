      "The event is triggered by an action or occurrence where an individual begins a new role, job, or position within an organization, institution, or other entity. Examples of triggers include 'replace,' 'took on,' and 'begins.'",
      "This event captures the moment an individual formally assumes a new position, typically within a specified organizational or geographical context.",
      "Unlike related events such as Nominate or Elect, StartPosition focuses on the start of a role rather than the process leading up to the selection or the termination of a previous position.",
      "Triggers such as 'becomes' or 'takes office' signify the commencement of a position, as opposed to terms like 'resigns' or 'steps down,' which indicate EndPosition events.",
      "The event involves identifying the individual (person) taking the position, the position or organization (entity) involved, and optionally, the geographical location (place) where the position is assumed."

  "attributes": {
    "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
    "entity": [
      "Examples are organizations, institutions, or specific positions associated with the new role being assumed, such as 'unit' or 'London School of Economics'.",
      "This argument highlights the context or domain of the new role, often specifying the organization or entity the individual is joining or leading.",
      "Entities are crucial for distinguishing the type and scope of the position, whether it pertains to leadership, administrative, or specialized roles.",
      "Unlike the person argument, which identifies the individual assuming the role, entities refer to the broader organizational or institutional context.",
      "In ambiguous cases, entities may be inferred from descriptions of the role or organization mentioned in the same context as the event trigger."
    ],
    "person": [
      "Examples are individuals beginning a new position, such as 'Jean-Rene Fourtou' or 'Roh Moo-Hyun'.",
      "The person is the central figure in the event, described as assuming, taking on, or beginning a specified role.",
      "This argument is critical for understanding the agent of the event, differentiating StartPosition from other PersonnelEvents where the role or position itself might take precedence.",
      "Unlike entities or places, the person argument focuses solely on the individual taking the role, irrespective of the organizational or geographical context.",
      "In cases where multiple individuals are involved, annotate all explicitly mentioned individuals assuming distinct roles or positions."
    ],
    "place": [
      "Examples are specific locations where the position is assumed or where the individual begins their new role, such as 'Paris'.",
      "The place argument situates the event geographically, providing context about where the position or role is being assumed.",
      "Unlike the entity argument, which specifies the organizational context, place focuses on the physical or geopolitical location of the event.",
      "Places are optional and may not be present if the text does not specify a location; however, they should be annotated when explicitly mentioned.",
      "In cases where multiple locations are mentioned, prioritize the one most closely tied to the start of the position."
