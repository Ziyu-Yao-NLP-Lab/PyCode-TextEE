            "The event is characterized by the end of an organization's existence or its functional operations. This can include political regimes, companies, or other formal groups.",
            "Unlike the StartOrg event, which marks the beginning of an organization, the EndOrg event signifies the cessation of its activities or existence.",
            "Triggers such as 'opening' or 'launching' are indicative of the StartOrg event, not the EndOrg event. Similarly, 'merging' is related to the MergeOrg event, not the EndOrg event.",
            "The outcomes of the EndOrg event include the complete cessation of the organization's activities, often leading to significant changes in the associated domain, such as political shifts or market changes."

            "Edge cases include situations where the place is implied rather than explicitly stated. For example, 'the regime collapsed' might imply a specific country or region without directly mentioning it."
