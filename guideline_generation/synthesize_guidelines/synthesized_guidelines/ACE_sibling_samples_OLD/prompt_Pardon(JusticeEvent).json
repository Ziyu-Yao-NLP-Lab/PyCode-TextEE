  "Pardon(JusticeEvent)": {
    "description": [
      "The event is triggered by an act of forgiveness or absolution granted by an adjudicator, typically nullifying or reducing the penalties imposed on a defendant. Examples of triggers include 'pardoned,' 'clear,' and 'forgive.'",
      "This event focuses on the official or formal removal of legal penalties or convictions, often involving a defendant and an adjudicator authorized to grant clemency.",
      "Unlike events such as Acquit, which focuses on declaring innocence, Pardon assumes guilt but mitigates or removes the consequences of the offense.",
      "Triggers such as 'pardoned' and 'cleared' are indicative of this event, as opposed to 'convicted' or 'sentenced,' which emphasize the imposition of penalties rather than their removal.",
      "This event highlights the authority of the adjudicator in granting relief to the defendant, often tied to specific geopolitical or judicial contexts."

  "attributes": {
    "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
    "adjudicator": [
      "Examples are individuals or entities with the authority to grant pardons, such as 'Abdullah II' or 'board of pardon and paroles'.",
      "The adjudicator argument identifies the official or institutional body responsible for issuing the pardon, emphasizing their authoritative role.",
      "Unlike defendants, adjudicators are not implicated in the offense but act as the arbiters or granters of clemency.",
      "This argument is crucial for distinguishing Pardon from related events like ReleaseParole, where the focus is on the act of release rather than the granting of clemency.",
      "In cases where multiple adjudicators are mentioned, annotate all entities explicitly involved in granting the pardon."
    ],
    "defendant": [
      "Examples are individuals or entities receiving the pardon, such as 'legislator' or 'their' (multiple defendants).",
      "The defendant argument focuses on the party benefiting from the pardon, whose penalties or convictions are being nullified or reduced.",
      "This argument is central to the event, differentiating the Pardon event from others where the defendant's guilt or punishment is being debated or enacted.",
      "Unlike adjudicators, defendants are the recipients of clemency, often mentioned in the context of prior offenses or convictions.",
      "In cases involving multiple defendants, annotate all explicitly mentioned individuals who are granted clemency."
    ],
    "place": [
      "Examples are locations where the pardon is granted or has jurisdictional relevance, such as 'Jordan'.",
      "The place argument situates the event within a specific geopolitical or judicial context, enhancing the specificity of the event annotation.",
      "Unlike the adjudicator argument, which identifies the granting authority, place refers to the broader geographical setting of the event.",
      "This argument may be optional if the text does not explicitly mention a location; however, annotate it when present.",
      "In cases where multiple places are mentioned, prioritize the one most directly tied to the adjudication or granting of the pardon."
