        "description": [
            "The event is triggered by the formal declaration of a defendant's guilt in a court of law. Example triggers include 'convicted', 'found guilty', and 'declared guilty'.",
            "The event is characterized by the legal determination that an individual or group has committed a crime, typically following a trial or legal proceeding.",
            "Unlike the 'Sentence' event, which focuses on the punishment assigned, the 'Convict' event centers on the determination of guilt. For example, 'sentenced to 10 years' is indicative of a 'Sentence' event, not a 'Convict' event.",
            "Triggers such as 'extradition' or 'hearing' are indicative of 'Extradite' or 'TrialHearing' events, respectively, not the 'Convict' event type.",
            "The outcome of the 'Convict' event is the formal recognition of guilt, which may lead to subsequent events such as sentencing or appeals."

            "In some cases, the adjudicator may be a collective body, such as a 'panel of judges' or 'tribunal'.",
            "Unlike the 'defendant', the adjudicator is not the one being judged but the one making the judgment.",

            "Unlike the 'adjudicator', the defendant is the one whose actions are being judged.",

            "In some cases, the place may refer to the jurisdiction or legal authority, such as 'federal court' or 'state court'.",
