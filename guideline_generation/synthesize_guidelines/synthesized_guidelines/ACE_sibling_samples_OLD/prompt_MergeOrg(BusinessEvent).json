    "description": [
      "The event is triggered by the union or consolidation of two or more organizations, entities, or businesses into a single entity. Examples of triggers include 'merger,' 'merged,' and 'tying the knot.'",
      "This event captures the process of combining separate entities, often for operational, financial, or strategic reasons, with emphasis on the organizations involved.",
      "Unlike StartOrg, which focuses on the creation of a new organization, MergeOrg emphasizes the combination of pre-existing entities.",
      "Triggers such as 'remerger' and 'create larger conglomerates' distinguish MergeOrg from EndOrg, which marks the dissolution or cessation of an organization.",
      "The event involves identifying the organizations being merged (org), which are central to understanding the scope and impact of the merger."
    ]

  "attributes": {
    "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
    "org": [
      "Examples are the organizations involved in the merger, such as 'Department of Minority Business Enterprise' and 'Department of Business Assistance', or 'Oracle' and 'Peoplesoft'.",
      "The org argument identifies the entities being merged, emphasizing their roles as the primary participants in the event.",
      "This argument is critical for understanding the dynamics of the event, as it focuses on the entities affected by the consolidation process.",
      "Unlike related arguments in other BusinessEvent types, such as agent in StartOrg, the org argument refers exclusively to pre-existing entities being unified.",
      "In cases where multiple organizations are involved, annotate all explicitly mentioned entities to provide a comprehensive representation of the merger."
