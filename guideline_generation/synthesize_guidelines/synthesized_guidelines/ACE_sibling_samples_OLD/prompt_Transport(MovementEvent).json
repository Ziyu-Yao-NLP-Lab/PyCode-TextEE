        "description": [
            "The event is triggered by an action that involves moving entities (people, vehicles, or objects) from one place to another. Example triggers include 'transport', 'drove', and 'carting'.",
            "The event is characterized by the relocation of artifacts, people, or vehicles, where the movement is from a defined origin to a specific destination, often involving an agent who facilitates this movement.",
            "Unlike general MovementEvent where any movement is involved, Transport specifically focuses on the purposeful, directed movement of entities from one location to another for a particular reason, often involving a vehicle.",
            "This event type differs from events like TransferOwnership in that it pertains to physical movement rather than changes in ownership or control, even though both may involve moving items.",
            "Triggers such as 'took' in the context of moving to locations, or 'drove' related to vehicle use, specifically indicate Transport, not other types of MovementEvents such as 'walking' or 'running'."

    },
    "attributes": {
        "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
        "agent": [
            "Examples are instances where an entity initiates or is responsible for the transportation action. In 'forces assisted by getting back into Iraq', 'forces' is the agent.",
            "This argument identifies who is orchestrating or carrying out the transport, crucial in scenarios involving organized movements or operations.",
            "In cases where transportation involves coordination or security, the agent is typically a group or individual with the capability or authority to manage such movements, like 'medical teams' in emergency situations.",
            "The agent's role is especially prominent when the transport requires special arrangements or authorizations, highlighting their authority or logistical role.",
            "Agents are not always human; they can be organizations, forces, or other entities capable of directing or facilitating movement."
        ],
        "artifact": [
            "Examples are physical objects or individuals being moved as part of the event, such as 'women', 'children', or 'teams' in disaster response scenarios.",
            "This argument is central to defining what is being transported, from individuals in a rescue operation to items in a shipment.",
            "Artifacts can vary widely, from animate to inanimate; understanding the nature of the artifact helps clarify the purpose and method of transport.",
            "In some contexts, artifacts may also include abstract entities or groups moved en masse, such as 'protesters' during demonstrations.",
            "The distinction of an artifact from other arguments like 'victim' lies in its role as the primary object of the transport, irrespective of its own agency."
        ],
        "destination": [
            "Examples are the intended final location to which the artifacts are being transported, like 'Manhattan' in a travel scenario, or 'Sudan' for refugees.",
            "This argument specifies where the transported entities are meant to end up, which can be as broad as a country or as specific as a building.",
            "In scenarios involving multiple stops or complex routes, the destination is typically the final stop or primary target location.",
            "Understanding the destination is crucial for determining the scope and intent of the transportation, affecting logistical and strategic planning.",
            "Destinations can sometimes be symbolic or strategic, such as 'streets' during protests or rallies, highlighting broader socio-political objectives."

        ],
        "origin": [
            "Examples are the starting point of the transport, such as 'Pennsylvania' from where someone drove to an event, or 'Sudan' from where refugees were moved.",
            "This argument details the initial location from which the transport begins, setting the context for the journey or movement.",
            "Origins can be as diverse as destinations and provide critical information about the route, distance, and potential challenges involved.",
            "The origin can also imply reasons for the transport, such as evacuation from a disaster zone or departure for a significant event.",
            "In contrast to destinations, origins often carry implications about the conditions or situations prompting the transport."
        ],
        "place": [
            "Examples are specific locations associated with the transport event but not necessarily origins or destinations, like 'Iraq' in the context of a military operation.",
            "This argument captures the broader geographical or contextual setting of the transport, which may encompass multiple areas or points of interest.",
            "Places can be transit points, areas of conflict, or regions affected by the transport, providing a backdrop to the event.",
            "In documentation, distinguishing 'place' from 'origin' and 'destination' is key for clarity, especially in complex logistical operations.",
            "Places add depth to the narrative of transport, illustrating the environment, challenges, or scope of the movement involved."
        ],
        "vehicle": [
            "Examples are means of transport used in the event, such as 'trains' for moving large numbers of people or goods, or cars in individual travel cases.",
            "This argument defines the physical means by which transport is accomplished, highlighting the mode and capacity of the transport.",
            "Vehicles can range from standard cars and buses to specialized machinery like ambulances or military transports, depending on the event.",
            "The choice of vehicle often reflects the nature of the artifact being transported and the conditions of the journey.",
            "In many scenarios, the vehicle itself can be a critical factor in the event's feasibility and success, such as in evacuations or critical deliveries."
        ],
        "victim": [
            "Examples are individuals or entities that are involuntarily moved or impacted by the transport, such as 'who' in the context of forced relocations or evacuations.",
            "This argument highlights those who are transported not by their own volition but due to external circumstances or emergencies.",
            "Victims are often central to humanitarian transport events, where the focus is on rescue, relief, or escape from danger.",
            "Distinguishing victims from artifacts is crucial; victims are specifically those affected adversely by the transport scenario.",
            "In some cases, the term 'victim' can also reflect broader socio-political dynamics, as in the displacement of populations during conflicts."
