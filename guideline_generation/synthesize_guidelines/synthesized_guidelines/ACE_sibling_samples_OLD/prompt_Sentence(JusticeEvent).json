    "description": [
      "The event is triggered by an action or decision in which a formal punishment or penalty is assigned to a defendant by a legal authority. Examples of triggers include 'sentence,' 'sentenced,' and 'imposed.'",
      "This event involves the adjudication of a legal judgment, typically specifying the defendant, the adjudicator responsible for delivering the sentence, and optionally, the location of the judgment.",
      "Unlike Convict, which focuses on the determination of guilt, Sentence emphasizes the assignment of penalties or punishments following a conviction.",
      "Triggers like 'sentences' or 'imposed penalties' are indicative of this event type, as opposed to 'convicted,' which highlights the determination of criminal liability.",
      "The event captures the culmination of a legal process where a defendant is formally given a punishment, often involving jail time, fines, or other penalties."
    ]

  "attributes": {
    "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
    "adjudicator": [
      "Examples are the legal authorities or institutions delivering the sentence, such as 'courts' or 'Supreme Court'.",
      "This argument identifies the entity responsible for assigning the penalty, emphasizing the role of judicial authority in the event.",
      "Adjudicators are critical for distinguishing Sentence from extrajudicial punishments, as they provide formal legal context.",
      "Unlike defendants, adjudicators are neutral entities tasked with executing the judicial process rather than being involved in the alleged offense.",
      "In ambiguous cases, the adjudicator may be inferred from references to legal systems or institutions, such as 'judge' or 'jury.'"
    ],
    "defendant": [
      "Examples are individuals or entities receiving the sentence, such as 'smugglers' or 'Anwar Ibrahim'.",
      "Defendants are the primary recipients of the punishment or penalty delivered in the sentencing process.",
      "This argument is crucial for identifying the party held accountable for the crime or violation being addressed.",
      "Unlike adjudicators, defendants are directly involved in the offense or case, and their actions or behavior are central to the legal outcome.",
      "In cases involving multiple defendants, all explicitly mentioned individuals should be annotated, provided they are clearly tied to the sentencing."
    ],
    "place": [
      "Examples are locations where the sentencing event occurs, such as 'Indonesian' (referring to courts in Indonesia).",
      "The place argument situates the sentencing within a geographical or judicial context, adding specificity to the event.",
      "Unlike adjudicators, which are institutions or individuals, the place refers to physical or geopolitical settings of the sentencing.",
      "Places are optional and may not always be mentioned; however, they should be annotated when explicitly provided.",
      "In cases with multiple locations, prioritize the one most directly linked to the adjudication or delivery of the sentence."
