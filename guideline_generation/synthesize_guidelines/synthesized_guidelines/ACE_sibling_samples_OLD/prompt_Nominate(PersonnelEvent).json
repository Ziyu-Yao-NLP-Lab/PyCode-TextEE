      "The event is triggered by an action or announcement designating an individual as a candidate or appointee for a role, position, or honor. Examples of triggers include 'nominate,' 'named,' and 'announcement.'",
      "This event captures the act of putting forward an individual for consideration, typically involving an agent who nominates and a person who is the nominee.",
      "Unlike StartPosition, which focuses on the assumption of a role, Nominate emphasizes the proposal or recommendation phase prior to formal appointment.",
      "Triggers such as 'nominated' and 'candidate for nomination' distinguish this event from Elect, which involves a formal selection or voting process.",
      "This event involves identifying the agent initiating the nomination and the person being nominated, highlighting the recommendation phase in personnel processes."

    "agent": [
      "Examples are individuals or entities responsible for making the nomination, such as 'pope' or 'British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown'.",
      "The agent argument identifies the actor initiating the nomination, emphasizing their role in recommending or proposing the candidate.",
      "This argument is central to the event, distinguishing the nominator from the person being nominated.",
      "Unlike the person argument, which focuses on the nominee, the agent refers to the initiator of the nomination process.",
      "In cases where no explicit agent is mentioned, the argument may be inferred from the broader context of the text."

    "person": [
      "Examples are individuals being nominated for a role, such as 'head' or 'candidate'.",
      "The person argument identifies the nominee, who is proposed or recommended for a position or honor.",
      "This argument is crucial for understanding the focus of the nomination event, differentiating it from related actions involving the role or organization.",
      "Unlike the agent argument, which identifies the nominator, the person argument refers exclusively to the individual being nominated.",
      "In cases where multiple nominees are mentioned, annotate all explicitly identified individuals proposed for consideration."
