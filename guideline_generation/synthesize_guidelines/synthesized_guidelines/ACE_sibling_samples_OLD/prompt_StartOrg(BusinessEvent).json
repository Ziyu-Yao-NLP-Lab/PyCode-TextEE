    "description": [
      "The event is triggered by the creation, launch, or establishment of an organization, institution, or entity. Examples of triggers include 'founded,' 'launched,' and 'forging.'",
      "This event marks the formal initiation of an organization’s existence, often involving an agent who facilitates or announces its creation.",
      "Unlike related events such as MergeOrg or EndOrg, which involve changes or cessation of existing organizations, StartOrg exclusively focuses on the formation or inception of new organizations.",
      "Triggers such as 'create' or 'opening' signify the start of a new organization, whereas terms like 'merge' or 'dissolve' pertain to organizational restructuring or termination.",
      "The event highlights the beginning of organizational activity, often including details about the entity itself (org), the initiator (agent), and optionally, the geographical location (place)."

    "mention": "The text span that triggers the event.",
    "agent": [
      "Examples are individuals, groups, or entities responsible for initiating or facilitating the creation of the organization, such as 'Kim Dae-Jung' or 'Daily Planet Ltd'.",
      "Agents are often explicitly mentioned as founders, leaders, or sponsors of the new organization.",
      "This argument highlights the entity’s originator or driving force, distinguishing StartOrg from events where the agent is not central to the organizational activity.",
      "Unlike the org argument, which refers to the entity being created, agents represent the external actors initiating the creation process.",
      "In cases involving multiple agents, annotate all mentioned entities contributing to the establishment of the organization."

    "org": [
      "Examples are the names or descriptions of the new organizations being formed, such as 'Millennium Democratic Party' or 'Disneyland'.",
      "The org argument represents the central entity of the event, emphasizing the organization that is coming into existence.",
      "This argument is crucial for identifying the focal point of the event, providing clarity on what entity is being established.",
      "Unlike agents or places, org refers specifically to the entity being created, not those facilitating or hosting the event.",
      "Edge cases may include generic references (e.g., 'a new party'); annotate the most specific description of the organization available."
    ],
    "place": [
      "Examples are geographical locations where the organization is established or announced, such as 'here' (Melbourne).",
      "The place argument situates the creation event within a specific physical or geopolitical context, offering additional detail about the organization's origin.",
      "Unlike the org argument, which focuses on the entity being created, place specifies the geographical setting where the event occurs.",
      "Places are optional and may not be present if the text does not specify a location; however, they should be annotated when explicitly mentioned.",
      "In cases with multiple locations, prioritize the location most directly tied to the creation or formal launch of the organization."
