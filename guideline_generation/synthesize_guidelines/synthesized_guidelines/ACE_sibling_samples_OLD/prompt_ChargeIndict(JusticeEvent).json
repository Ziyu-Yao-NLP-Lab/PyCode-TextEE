        "description": [
            "The event is triggered by an individual or entity being formally accused of a crime or legal violation, often marked by specific legal language such as 'charged,' 'accused,' or related terms.",
            "The action involves the formal accusation process within a legal or judicial framework, distinguishing it from broader justice-related events such as arrests or trials.",
            "There is a clear identifier of the judicial process starting, separating this event from the conclusion of judicial processes like convictions or sentencing.",
            "Legal representatives, such as prosecutors or legal documents, initiate or describe the charges, thereby engaging the justice system formally.",
            "It includes specific roles such as adjudicator, defendant, prosecutor, and place, which are integral to setting the legal stage for the indictment or charge process."

        "adjudicator": [
            "Examples are individuals or entities that oversee the legal proceeding or have the authority to make judicial decisions regarding the indictment, such as judges or magistrates.",
            "This role is crucial as it defines who is formally overseeing or making declarations about the charge.",
            "In cases where the term 'adjudicator' is ambiguous, it refers to any authoritative figure directly involved in the legal adjudication process.",
            "Typically identified by their role or title within the context of a legal document or statement.",
            "Distinct from a 'prosecutor' who actively argues or presents the case against the defendant."

        "defendant": [
            "Examples are individuals, groups, or entities who are being formally charged or indicted.",
            "This argument is central to the event as it identifies whom the charges are against.",
            "Can be explicitly named or referred to by their relation to the case (e.g., 'the accused,' 'the former president').",
            "Identification often occurs in the context of legal accusations or when mentioned in relation to a crime.",
            "It is critical to distinguish defendants from witnesses or other parties involved in a case."

        "place": [
            "Examples are geographical locations or specific venues where the charge or indictment is filed or is pertinent.",
            "Essential for contextualizing the event, indicating jurisdiction or specific location relevance like a city, court, or country.",
            "Places are often mentioned explicitly but can be implied through known contexts or related legal entities.",
            "Helps in understanding the scope and legal boundaries of the charge.",
            "Not to be confused with incidental locations unrelated to the legal proceedings."

        "prosecutor": [
            "Examples are individuals, often part of a governmental or legal body, who formally bring the charges against the defendant.",
            "This role is integral in initiating the legal action that triggers the ChargeIndict event.",
            "Can be named directly or identified through their involvement in the legal process.",
            "Key in differentiating the driving force of the indictment from the adjudicator's role.",
            "Unlike adjudicators, prosecutors actively pursue the charges and present evidence."
