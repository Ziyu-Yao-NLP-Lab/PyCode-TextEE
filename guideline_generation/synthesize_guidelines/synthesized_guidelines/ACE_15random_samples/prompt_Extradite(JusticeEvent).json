            "The event is triggered by the act of transferring a person from one jurisdiction to another for legal proceedings. Example triggers include 'extradite', 'extradition', and 'extraditing'.",
            "The event is triggered by legal actions involving the formal process of handing over a suspect or convicted individual from one authority to another. Key characteristics include the involvement of legal authorities and the movement of the person across jurisdictions.",
            "The event is triggered by the legal process where a person is sent from one place to another to face charges or serve a sentence. Unlike the 'ArrestJail' event, this event involves cross-jurisdictional transfer rather than initial detention.",
            "The event is triggered by the formal request and subsequent transfer of an individual from one state or country to another for legal reasons. Triggers such as 'extradition' are indicative of this event type, not 'Transport' which involves general movement without legal context.",
            "The event is triggered by the legal procedure of surrendering a person from one jurisdiction to another, often involving international or interstate cooperation. This event differs from 'ReleaseParole' as it focuses on the transfer for prosecution or punishment rather than release from custody."
