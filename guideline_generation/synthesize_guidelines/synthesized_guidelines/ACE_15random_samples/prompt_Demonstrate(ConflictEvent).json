            "The event is triggered by public gatherings or actions where people express their opinions, often in opposition to something. Example triggers include 'rally', 'march', 'protest', 'gathered', and 'campaign'.",
            "The event is characterized by collective actions such as marches, rallies, or protests, typically involving a significant number of participants. It often involves public displays of dissent or support for a cause.",
            "Unlike other ConflictEvents, this event does not involve direct physical confrontations or violence as the primary focus, although such incidents may occur as a secondary outcome. For example, 'clash' or 'riot' would indicate a different event type.",
            "Triggers such as 'meeting' or 'conference' are indicative of organized, formal gatherings and are not considered part of this event type. Demonstrate events are more spontaneous or grassroots in nature.",
            "The outcomes of this event type often include public awareness, media coverage, and sometimes arrests or clashes with authorities, but the primary focus is on the act of demonstrating itself."

            "In some cases, the place might be a specific landmark or building, such as 'White House', which can add significance to the event due to the symbolic nature of the location.",
