            "The event is triggered by the establishment or creation of a new organization. Example triggers include 'founded', 'created', 'launched', 'opened', and 'built'.",
            "The event is characterized by the initiation of a new business entity or organization, often involving an agent responsible for the creation and a specific location where the organization is established.",
            "Unlike events such as 'Nominate' or 'Elect', which involve assigning roles within existing organizations, 'StartOrg' focuses on the inception of entirely new entities.",
            "Triggers such as 'founded' and 'launched' are indicative of 'StartOrg', whereas triggers like 'appointed' or 'elected' are related to personnel changes within existing organizations.",
            "The outcome of the 'StartOrg' event is the existence of a new organization, which differentiates it from events like 'MergeOrg' or 'AcquireOrg', where existing entities are combined or taken over."

            "In some cases, the agent may be implied or not explicitly mentioned in the text. For instance, 'we' in 'we are going to build a monster'.",
            "The agent is crucial for understanding who is behind the creation of the organization, providing context and accountability. Examples are 'Twentieth Century Fox' in 'he helped launch the Fox Television network'.",
            "Unlike the 'org' argument, which refers to the new entity being created, the agent refers to the initiator of the creation process. Examples are 'Daily Planet Ltd' in 'plans to follow up its May Day launching by opening a 'sex Disneyland''."
