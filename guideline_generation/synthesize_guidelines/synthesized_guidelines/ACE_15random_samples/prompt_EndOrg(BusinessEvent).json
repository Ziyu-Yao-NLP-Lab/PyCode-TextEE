            "The event is triggered by the termination or dissolution of an organization. Example triggers include 'is no more', 'dissolving', 'dismantling', 'crumbled', and 'collapsed'.",
            "The event is characterized by the end of an organization's existence or its functional operations. This can be due to various reasons such as political changes, internal decisions, or external pressures.",
            "Unlike events that signify changes within an organization (e.g., StartPosition), this event specifically marks the complete cessation of the organization's activities.",
            "Triggers such as 'hearing' or 'charges' are indicative of JusticeEvent types, not this event type, as they pertain to legal proceedings rather than the end of an organization.",
            "The outcomes of this event type involve the organization ceasing to exist or operate, which is different from events like 'Demonstrate' or 'Attack' that involve conflict but do not necessarily result in the end of an organization."

            "In the context of this event, 'place' refers to the location associated with the organization's end. For instance, 'Iraq' in the phrase 'the focus in Iraq is turning from military action to rebuilding'.",

            "Edge cases include situations where the location is implied rather than explicitly stated. For example, 'the local Baath Party leadership was crumbling' implies a specific location without directly naming it."
