            "The event is triggered by any form of communication made via telephone or similar devices, such as a phone call, telephone conversation, or message. Example triggers include 'telephone', 'call', 'told', 'discussed', 'phone', 'chatted', 'contacted', and 'written'.",
            "The event is characterized by the exchange of information or messages between entities through a phone or similar communication device. It involves at least one entity initiating the contact and another entity receiving it.",
            "Unlike other ContactEvents, the PhoneWrite event specifically involves the use of a telephone or similar device as the medium of communication. For instance, 'discussed' in the context of a phone conversation is a trigger for PhoneWrite, but 'discussed' in a face-to-face meeting is not.",
            "Triggers such as 'call' and 'telephone' are indicative of the PhoneWrite event type, not other ContactEvents like face-to-face meetings or written correspondence without the use of a phone.",
            "The outcome of the PhoneWrite event is the successful transmission of information or messages between entities via a phone or similar device. This distinguishes it from other events where the medium of communication is different, such as emails or in-person conversations."

            "Places are important as they provide context to the communication. In 'She called from New York,' 'New York' is the place.",
            "The place can be a specific location or a broader area. For example, in 'They discussed by phone from the White House,' 'White House' is the place.",
            "In some cases, the place might be implied or not explicitly mentioned. For example, in 'He called her,' if the context indicates a location, it should be annotated as the place."
