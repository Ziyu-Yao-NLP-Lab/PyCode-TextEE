            "The event is triggered by the formal decision of a court or legal authority to declare a defendant not guilty of the charges against them. Example triggers include 'acquitted', 'walk free', and 'acquittal'.",
            "The event is characterized by the legal exoneration of a defendant, meaning they are released from the charges and any associated penalties. This event is specific to the legal context and involves a formal judicial process.",
            "Unlike the 'Convict' event, which results in a guilty verdict, the 'Acquit' event results in a not guilty verdict. Triggers such as 'convicted' are indicative of the 'Convict' event type, not the 'Acquit' event type.",
            "The outcome of the 'Acquit' event is the release of the defendant from legal charges, whereas similar events like 'Sentence' or 'Convict' result in the imposition of penalties or a guilty verdict.",
            "The event is distinct from other JusticeEvents such as 'ArrestJail' or 'Sentence', as it specifically involves the exoneration of the defendant. Triggers like 'arrested' or 'sentenced' are not indicative of the 'Acquit' event type."

            "Examples are the legal authority or body responsible for delivering the acquittal verdict. This can include judges, courts, or juries. For instance, in 'The court acquitted the defendant', 'court' is the adjudicator.",
            "The adjudicator plays a crucial role in the event as they are the ones who determine the outcome of the trial. In 'Judge Smith acquitted the defendant', 'Judge Smith' is the adjudicator.",

            "In cases where the defendant is referred to by a role or title rather than a name, they are still considered the defendant. For example, 'The accused was acquitted' refers to the defendant.",
            "The defendant must be the party against whom the charges were initially brought. Unlike a 'witness' or 'victim', the defendant is the one standing trial.",
            "Edge cases include scenarios where the defendant is part of a group. For example, in 'Several defendants were acquitted', each member of the group is considered a defendant."
