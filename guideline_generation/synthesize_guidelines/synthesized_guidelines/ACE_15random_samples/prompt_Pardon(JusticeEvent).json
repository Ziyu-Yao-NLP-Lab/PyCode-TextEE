            "The event is triggered by an official act of forgiving or excusing a person from a punishment or legal consequence. Example triggers include 'pardoned', 'cleared', and 'forgiven'.",
            "The event is characterized by the involvement of an adjudicator who grants the pardon, a defendant who receives the pardon, and sometimes a specific place where the pardon is issued.",
            "Unlike the Convict event, which involves a legal judgment of guilt, the Pardon event involves the nullification or forgiveness of such a judgment.",
            "Triggers such as 'convicted' or 'sentenced' are indicative of the Convict or Sentence event types, not the Pardon event type.",
            "The outcome of a Pardon event is the release or forgiveness of the defendant from legal penalties, distinguishing it from events like Execute or Fine, which impose penalties."

            "In some cases, the adjudicator may be a single individual, such as a president or governor, while in others, it may be a collective body like a court or parole board.",

            "In some cases, the defendant may be a well-known public figure, while in others, it may be a less prominent individual.",
            "The defendant must be distinguished from other roles in justice events, such as the plaintiff in an Appeal event or the victim in a Die event.",

        "place": [
            "Examples are 'Jordan', 'Manhattan', 'Indonesian'. The place is the location where the pardon is issued or takes effect.",

            "In some cases, the place may be a specific city or country, while in others, it may be a more general region or jurisdiction.",
